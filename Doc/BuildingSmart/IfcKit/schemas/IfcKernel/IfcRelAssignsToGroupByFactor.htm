<p>The objectified relationship <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</em> is a specialization of the general grouping mechanism. It allows to add a factor to define the ratio that applies to the assignment of object definitions (individual object occurrences as subtypes of <em>IfcObject</em> and object types as subtypes of <em>IfcTypeObject</em>) to a group (subtypes of <em>IfcGroup</em>).</p>

<p>The ratio can be used to define a percentage assignment.  For example, a <em>Factor</em> of 0.8 would indicate that the object is assigned by 80% to the group, or a <em>Factor</em> of 2.5 would indicate the object is assigned with a weight factor of 2.5 to the group.</p> 

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Examples of factored groups include the assignment of load cases in a load combination in structural analysis, or the assignment of spaces by percentage to different rental zones.

<p>The same object or object type may be included with the same or different <em>Factor</em> values to many groups. Grouping relationships are not hierarchical.</p>
