<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
An open shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2. Its domain, if present, is a finite, connected, oriented,
2-manifold with boundary, but is not a closed surface. It can be thought of as a closed shell with one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open
shell satisfies 0 &lt; &Xi; &lt; 1. An open shell is functionally more general than a face because its domain can have handles.
<br><br> 
The shell is defined by a collection of faces, which may be oriented faces. The sense of each face, after taking account of the orientation, shall
agree with the shell normal as defined below. The orientation can be supplied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if
the shell member is a face without the orientation attribute.
<br><br>
The following combinatorial restrictions on open shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed, together with the informal
propositions, to ensure that any domain associated with an open shell is an orientable manifold.
<ul> 
 <li class="extDef">Each face reference shall be unique. </li> 
 <li class="extDef">An open shell shall have at least one face. </li> 
 <li class="extDef">A given face may exist in more than one open shell.</li> 
</ul>
<br>
The boundary of an open shell consists of the edges that are referenced only once by the face - bounds (loops) of its faces, together with all of their
vertices. The domain of an open shell, if present, contains all edges and vertices of its faces.
<br>
<br>
NOTE&nbsp; Note that this is slightly different from the definition of a face domain, which includes none of its bounds. For example, a
face domain may exclude an isolated point or line segment. An open shell domain may not. (See the algorithm for computing below.)
