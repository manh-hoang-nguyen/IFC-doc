<p>The <em>IfcRelAssignsToActor</em> objectified relationship defines a relationship between an <em>IfcActor</em> and one or many objects. A particular role of the actor played in that relationship can be associated. If specified, it takes priority over the role that may be directly assigned to the person or organization.</p>

<p>Reference to the objects (or single object) on which the actor acts upon in a certain role (if given) is specified in the inherited <em>RelatedObjects</em> attribute. </p>
