<p>The abstract entity <em>IfcBoundaryCondition</em>
is the supertype of all boundary conditions that can be applied to
structural connection definitions, either directly for the connection
(e.g. the joint) or for the relation between a structural member and
the connection.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The boundary conditions are used
within other parts, mainly by instances of <em>IfcStructuralConnection</em>
(for the definition of supports) and instances of <em>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</em>
(for the definition of connections between structural members and
structural connections).</blockquote>
