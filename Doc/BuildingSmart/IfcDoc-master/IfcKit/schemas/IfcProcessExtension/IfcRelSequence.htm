      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> is a
      sequential relationship between processes where one process
      must occur before the other in time and where the timing of
      the relationship may be described as a type of sequence.
      The relating process
      (<em>IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess</em>) is considered to be
      the predecessor in the relationship (has precedence) whilst
      the related process (<em>IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess</em>)
      is the successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> is defined as one-to-one
      relationship; therefore it assigns one predecessor to one
      successor.

      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> is used to describe the logical
      sequence relationship that exists between two processes.
      This logical relationship identifies that there is a
      predecessor or relating process and a successor or related
      process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one
      successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of
      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> may exist to describe the sequence
      relationships of a predecessor task with many successor
      tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task,
      thus enabling a m:n sequence relationship between tasks.
      Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define 
      dependencies between process occurrences but also between 
      process types (for further information see <em>IfcRelDefinesByObject</em> 
      and <em>IfcTaskType</em>). In case of defining dependencies between 
      process occurrences sequence relationships should stay 
      within the limits of a directed, non-cyclic graph.

      A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks
      assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the
      sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where
      the sequence relationship between processes is simply a
      logical flow, it need not be asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence
      type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the
      sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration
      (e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50%
      complete) or as a time measure (e.g. start successor task 1
      week after commencement of the predecessor task). Care
      should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence
      depending on the setting of the sequence type since there
      is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with
      the sequence type set.
