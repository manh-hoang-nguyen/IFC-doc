<p>The <em>IfcCurveStyleFontAndScaling</em> allows for the reuse of the same curve style definition in several sizes. The definition of the <em>CurveFontScale</em> is the scaling of a base curve style pattern to be used as a new or derived curve style pattern.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; The <em>CurveFontScale</em> should not be mixed up with the target plot scale.

<p>An example for <em>IfcCurveStyleFontAndScaling</em> is the sizing of a basic curve style dash pattern 'dash' (visible 0.01m, invisible 0.005m) into 'dash large' with&nbsp;<em>CurveFontScale</em> = 2 (resulting in&nbsp;visible 0.02m, invisible 0.01m), and into 'dash small'&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>CurveFontScale</em> = 0.5 (resulting in&nbsp;visible 0.005m, invisible 0.0025m).</p>

NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-46:1992<br>
A curve style font and scaling is a curve style font and a scalar factor for that font, so that a given curve style font may be applied at various scales.</blockquote>
