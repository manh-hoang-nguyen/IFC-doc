<p><em>IfcStyleModel</em> represents the concept of a particular presentation style defined for a material (or other characteristic) of a product or a product component within a representation context. This representation context may (but has not to be) a geometric representation context.</p>

<p><em>IfcStyleModel</em> can be a style representation (presentation style) of a material (via <em>IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation</em>), potentially differentiated for different representation contexts (for example, different material hatching depending on the scale of the target representation context).</p>
