<p>The <em>IfcStyledItem</em> holds presentation style information for products, either explicitly for an <em>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</em> being part of an <em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em> assigned to a product, or by assigning presentation information to <em>IfcMaterial</em> being assigned as other representation for a product.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <em>IfcStyledItem</em> is used within a reference from an <em>IfcProductDefinitionShape</em> then one <em>Item</em> shall be provided.</li>
<li>If the <em>IfcStyledItem</em> is used within a reference from an <em>IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation</em> then no <em>Item</em> shall be provided.</li>
</ul>
