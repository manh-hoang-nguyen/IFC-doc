<p><em>IfcSpatialElementType</em>
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a
spatial structure element and an optional set of product
representations. It is used to define a spatial element
specification (the specific element information, that is
common to all occurrences of that element type).</p>
<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as
representation maps (at the level of the supertype
<em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
occurrence instance through the
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
<em>IfcMappedItem</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>A spatial element type is used to define the common properties
of a certain type of a spatial structure element that may be
applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific
style. Spatial element types (i.e. the instantiable subtypes) may
be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The spatial element types are often used to
represent catalogues of predefined spatial types for shared
attributes, less so for sharing a common representation
map.
</blockquote>

<p>The occurrences of subtypes of the abstract
<em>IfcSpatialElementType</em> are represented by instances of
subtypes of the abstract <em>IfcSpatialElement</em>.</p>
