<p>The objectified relationship (<em>IfcRelAssociatesDocument</em>) handles the assignment of a document information (items of the select <em>IfcDocumentSelect</em>) to objects occurrences (subtypes of <em>IfcObject</em>) or object types (subtypes of <em>IfcTypeObject</em>).</p>

<p>The relationship is used to assign a document reference or a more detailed document information to objects. A single document reference can be applied to multiple objects.</p>

<p>The inherited attribute <em>RelatedObjects</em> define the objects to which the document association is applied. The attribute <em>RelatingDocument</em> is the reference to a document reference, applied to the object(s).</p>
