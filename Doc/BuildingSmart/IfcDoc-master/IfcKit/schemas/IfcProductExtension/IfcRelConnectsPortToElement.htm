      <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> is a relationship between a distribution element and dynamically connected 
      ports where connections are realised to other distribution elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ports contained in different elements are connected to each
      other using the <em>IfcRelConnectsPorts</em> relationship.

      IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The objectified relation
      <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> is now specialized for use of dynamically connected ports.  For fixed ports, use <em>IfcRelNests</em> instead.

      Previously this objectified relationship
      <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> defined the relationship
      that is made between a port and the <em>IfcElement</em> in which it is contained. It is a 1
      to 1 relationship. The <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em>
      established a whole part relationship between the element and
      its port. The port is used as the means to connect to other
      ports in other elements.
