<p><em>IfcTypeResource</em> defines a specific (or type) definition of a resource. It is used to define a resource specification (the specific resource, that is common to all occurrences that are defined for that resource) and could act as a resource template.</p>

<p>An <em>IfcTypeResource</em> may have a list of property sets attached. Values of these properties are common to all occurrences of that resource type. The type occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship <em>IfcRelDefinesByType</em>.</p>

<p>Subtypes of <em>IfcTypeResource</em> may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of <em>IfcResource</em>.</p>
