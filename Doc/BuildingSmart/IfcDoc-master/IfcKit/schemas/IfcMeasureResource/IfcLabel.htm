<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The set of characters that may appear in STRINGs exchanged in the exchange structure as defined in ISO 10303.21 is provided in ISO 10646.  The encoding of characters in case of file-based exchange is defined in ISO 10303-21 and ISO 10303-28.  Among else, these specifications define the encoding of 8-bit characters from ISO 8859-1...-16 and of 2-byte and 4-byte Unicode characters from ISO 10646.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp;  While <em>IfcIdentifier</em> is restricted to 255 characters, the size in exchange files after encoding may be considerably larger than 255 octets, depending on the particular encoding and on the contents of the identifier.</blockquote>
