      <p>
        This example includes three structural curve members forming a simple frame, and a single load case of a linear
        distributed load.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example includes three structural curve members connected in series, forming two columns and a beam, where
        the columns have rigid boundary conditions with respect to the ground. Each curve member has a material profile
        set defined using an I-Shape profile of steel material. The profile has properties indicating area and moments
        of inertia. The material has properties indicating density, modulus of elasticity, modulus of rigidity, and
        yield strength. One load case is defined, having a constant linear distribution over half of the beam. See
        Figure 510 for the geometric and topological representation of the structural members.

        The load case has calculated results included, consisting of point forces and moments at each point connection
        on the ground. See Figure 511 for the represenation of the structural members with
        reactions.
