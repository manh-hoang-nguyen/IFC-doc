<p><em>IfcComplexProperty</em> is used to define complex properties to be handled completely within a property set. The included set of properties may be a mixed or consistent collection of <em>IfcProperty</em> subtypes. This enables the definition of a set of properties to be included as a single 'property' entry in an <em>IfcPropertySet</em>. The definition of such an <em>IfcComplexProperty</em> can be reused in many different <em>IfcPropertySet</em>'s.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Since an <em>IfcComplexProperty</em> may contain other complex properties, sets of properties can be nested. This nesting may be restricted by view definitions and implementer agreements.
