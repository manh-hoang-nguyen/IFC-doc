<p><em>IfcPreDefinedPropertySet</em> is a generalization of all statically defined property sets that are assigned to an object or type object. The statically or pre-defined property sets are entities with a fixed list of attributes having particular defined data types.</p>

<p>Property sets are related to other objects by using the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Occurrence Object</b>: <em>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</em> using the inverse attribute <em>DefinesOccurrence</em>.</li>
 <li><b>Type Object</b>: using a direct link by inverse attribute <em>DefinesType</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>IfcPreDefinedPropertySet</em>'s can be assigned to objects and object types but do not have a defining property set template.</p>
