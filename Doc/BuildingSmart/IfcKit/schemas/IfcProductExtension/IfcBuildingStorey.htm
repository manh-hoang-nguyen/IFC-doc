<p>The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.</p>
<p>A storey is (if specified) associated to a building. A storey may span over several connected storeys. Therefore storey complex provides for a collection of storeys included in a building. A storey can also be decomposed in (horizontical) parts, where each part defines a partial storey. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype <em>IfcSpatialStructureElements</em> which is interpreted as follow:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>COMPLEX</b>: building storey complex</li>
 <li><b>ELEMENT</b>: building storey</li>
 <li><b>PARTIAL</b>: partial building storey</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; In split level houses, a storey is split into two or more partial storeys, each with a different elevation. It can be handled by defining a storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the individual elevations.</blockquote>

<p>The <em>IfcBuildingStorey</em> is used to build the spatial
structure of a building (that serves as the primary project
breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial
structure elements are linked together by using the objectified
relationship <em>IfcRelAggregates</em>.</p>


<p>Figure 3 shows the <em>IfcBuildingStorey</em> as part of the
s patial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for 
building and other elements.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Detailed requirements on mandatory element
containment and placement structure relationships are given in
view definitions and implementer agreements.</blockquote>
