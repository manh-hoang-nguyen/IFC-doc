      An <em>IfcProcedure</em> is a
      logical set of actions to be taken in response to an event
      or to cause an event to occur.

      <em>IfcProcedure</em> is used to capture information about
      stepped processes such as calibration, start/stop
      procedures for equipment items, designated actions to take
      in the event of an emergency etc. A procedure is not a
      task, but may describe a set of tasks and their order of
      occurrence in response to or to cause an event.
    </p>
     
    <p>As shown in Figure 11, <em>IfcProcedure</em> does not restrict anything but
    describes specific steps of how something should happen.
    While a procedure does control/restrict in the sense of
    indicating "this is how the task should be performed" by
    nature of describing inner detail, this is not different than
    parts of a product indicating "this is how the parts should
    be assembled". Consequently, it doesn't restrict the outer
    item as a whole but provides inner detail of the item.</p>
