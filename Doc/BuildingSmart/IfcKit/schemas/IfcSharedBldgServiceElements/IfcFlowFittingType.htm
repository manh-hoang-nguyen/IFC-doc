<p>The element type <em>IfcFlowFittingType</em> defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow fitting and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow fitting specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	     
<p>A flow fitting type is used to define the common properties of a flow fitting that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
A flow fitting is a device that is used to interconnect flow segments or other fittings within a distribution system, such as a tee in a ducted system that branches flow into two directions, or a junction box in an electrical distribution system.  Flow fitting types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcFlowFittingType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcFlowFitting</em> or its subtypes.</p>
