NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:<br>
The light source spot entity is a subtype of light source. Spot light source entities have a light source colour, position, direction, attenuation coefficients, concentration exponent, and spread angle. If a point lies outside the cone of influence of a light source of this type as determined by the light source position, direction and spread angle its colour is not affected by that light source.</blockquote> 

<blockquote class="note"> 
NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcLightSourceSpot</em> adds the <em>BeamWidthAngle</em> which defines the inner cone in which the light source emits light at uniform full intensity. The light source's emission intensity drops off from the inner solid angle (<em>BeamWidthAngle</em>) to the outer solid angle (<em>SpreadAngle</em>).

NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997:<br>
The Spot light node defines a light source that emits light from a specific point along a specific direction vector and constrained within a solid angle. Spot lights may illuminate geometry nodes that respond to light sources and intersect the solid angle defined by the Spot light. Spot light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system and are affected by ancestors' transformations. Figure 2 shows the definition of spot light.
