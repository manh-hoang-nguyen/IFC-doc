<p>An <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em> defines a point by coordinates in an orthogonal, right-handed Cartesian coordinate
system. For the purpose of this specification only two and three dimensional Cartesian points are used.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A cartesian_point is a point defined by its coordinates in a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, or in a parameter
space. The entity is defined in a one, two or three-dimensional space as determined by the number of coordinates in the
list. Depending upon the geometric representation context in which the point is used the names of the coordinates may
be (x,y,z), or (u,v), or any other chosen values.</blockquote>
