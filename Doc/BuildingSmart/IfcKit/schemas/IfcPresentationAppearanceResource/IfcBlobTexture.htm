<p>An <em>IfcBlobTexture</em> provides a 2-dimensional distribution of the lighting parameters of a surface onto which it is mapped. The texture itself is given as a single binary blob, representing the content of a pixel format file. The file format of the pixel file is given by the <em>RasterFormat</em> attribute and allowable formats are guided by where rule <em>SupportedRasterFormat</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Toolbox specific implementations of the binary datatype may restrict the maximum length of the binary blob to capture the raster file content.
