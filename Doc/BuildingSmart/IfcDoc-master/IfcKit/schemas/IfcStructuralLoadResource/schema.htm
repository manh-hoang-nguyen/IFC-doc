	 <p>The <em>IfcStructuralLoadResource</em> holds the definitions of
		structural loads, results, boundary conditions, and connection conditions. These
		definitions specify the force, moment, stiffness, displacement and other
		factors.</p>
	 <p>The load resource definitions are used in other parts of the IFC model,
		particularly by the definition of structural actions and reactions that places the
		load definitions into 2D or 3D space.</p>
