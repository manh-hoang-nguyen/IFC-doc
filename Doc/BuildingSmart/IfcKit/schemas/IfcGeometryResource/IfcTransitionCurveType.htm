<p>The <em>IfcTransitionCurveType</em> indicates the curvature of a transition curve.</p>

<p>Resulting cartesian coordinates (relative to starting position and orientation) are given by equations herein, where <i>l</i> (lowercase) refers to the distance along the curve segment, L refers to the length of the curve segment (<i>IfcCurveSegment2D</i>.<i>Length</i>), and R refers to the radius at the circular end of the curve segment (e.g. <i>IfcTransitionCurveSegment2D</i>.<i>EndRadius</i>).</p>
