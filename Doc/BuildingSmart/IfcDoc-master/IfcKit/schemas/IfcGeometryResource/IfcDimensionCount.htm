<p>The <em>IfcDimensionCount</em> defins the dimensionality of the coordinate space. It is restricted to have the
dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 for the purpose of this specification.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The shape representations assigned to a geometric representation context may
include geometric representation items of lower dimensionality, particularly when defining the boundary of planar
surfaces as 2D cross sections for the purpose of 3D swept areas.</blockquote>
