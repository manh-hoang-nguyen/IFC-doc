<p>The element type
<em>IfcTransportElementType</em> defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of transport elements. The set of
shared information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to define a transport element specification (i.e.
the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that beam type). Transport element types (or the
instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already
assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcTransportElementType</em> are
represented by instances of <em>IfcTransportElement</em> (or its
subtypes).</p>
