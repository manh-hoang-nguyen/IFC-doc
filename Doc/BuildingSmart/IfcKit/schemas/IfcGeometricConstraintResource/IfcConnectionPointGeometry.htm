<p><em>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</em>
is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the
physical connection of two objects at a point (here <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em>) or at an vertex with point
coordinates associated. It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection relationships. </p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The connection relationship between two path based elements (like a column and a beam) has a geometric constraint which describes the connection points by a <em>PointOnRelatingElement</em> for the column and a <em>PointOnRelatedElement</em> for the beam. The exact usage of the <em>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</em> is further defined in the geometry use sections of the elements that use it.
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>IfcPoint</em> (or the <em>IfcVertexPoint</em> with an associated <em>IfcPoint</em>) at the <em>PointOnRelatingElement</em> attribute defines the point where the basic geometry items of the connected elements connect. The point coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the <em>RelatingElement</em>, as specified at the <em>IfcRelConnectsSubtype</em> that utilizes the <em>IfcConnectionPointGeometry</em>. Optionally, the same point coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the <em>RelatedElement</em> by using the <em>PointOnRelatedElement</em> attribute. If both point coordinates are not identical within a common parent coordinate system (ultimately within the world coordinate system), the subtype <em>IfcConnectionPointEccentricity</em> shall be used. </p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; If the point connection has an offset (if the two points or vertex points at the relating and related element do not physically match), the subtype <em>IfcConnectionPointEccentricity</em> shall be used.
