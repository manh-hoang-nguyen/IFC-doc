<p>A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel,</p>

<p>The <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcDoorType</em> can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> has to be included for each door panel. The <em>PanelPosition</em> attribute, in conjunction with the <em>IfcDoorStyle.OperationType</em> attribute, determines to which panel the <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> apply. The <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> are included in the list of
properties , given by attribute <em>HasPropertySets</em> of the <em>IfcDoorType</em>. More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the <em>IfcDoorStyle</em> using the <em>IfcPropertySet</em> for dynamic extensions.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type(which is inserted by the <em>IfcDoor</em> into the spatial context of the project) as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>The parameters of the <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> define a standard door panel, including (if given) a proportional width to define non-uniform double swing (or sliding, or folding) doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the <em>IfcDoor</em>, which inserts the <em>IfcDoorType</em>. It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.</p>
