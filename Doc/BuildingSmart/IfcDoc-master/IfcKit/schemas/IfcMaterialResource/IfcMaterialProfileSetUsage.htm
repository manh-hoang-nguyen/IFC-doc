<p><em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> determines the usage of <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em> in terms of its location relative to the associated element geometry. The location of a material profile set shall be compatible with the building element geometry (that is, material profiles shall fit inside the element geometry). The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. For building elements with shape representations which are based on extruded solids, this is accomplished by referring to the identical profile definition in the shape model as in the material profile set.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material profile set usage.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The referenced <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em> may represent a single material
profile, or a composite profile with two or more material profiles.</blockquote>
