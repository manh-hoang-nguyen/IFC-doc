 <p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: This function checks whether the
start and end profile in a tapered extrusion are topologically
similar, i.e. whether both have the same number of vertices and
edges.</p>
<p>It returnes TRUE if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The start profile is defined by a paramterized profile
definition and
<ul>
<li>the end profile is either a derived profile, using the start
profile as its parent profile, or</li>
<li>the end profile is besed on the same subtype of the
paramterized profile definition as the start profile</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The start profile is defined by an arbitrary bounded curve
bounding a plane and
<ul>
<li>the end profile is a derived profile using the start profile
as its parent profile</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
