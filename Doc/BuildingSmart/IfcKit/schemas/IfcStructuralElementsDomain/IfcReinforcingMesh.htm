<p>Placement and representation are defined at the supertype <em>IfcElementComponent</em>.</p>

<p>The representation map of a mapped 'Outline' representation should contain a representation of type 'Curve3D' which holds an <em>IfcPolyline</em>.</p>

<p>The representation map of a mapped 'Body' representation should contain a representation of type 'AdvancedSweptSolid' which holds multiple <em>IfcSweptDiskSolid</em> (including subtype <em>IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal</em>).</p>
