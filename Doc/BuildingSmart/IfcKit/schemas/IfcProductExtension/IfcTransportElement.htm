      A transport element is a generalization of all transport related objects that move
      people, animals or goods within a building or building
      complex. The <em>IfcTransportElement</em> defines the
      occurrence of a transport element, that (if given), is
      expressed by the <em>IfcTransportElementType</em>.

      EXAMPLE&nbsp; Transportation elements include elevator
      (lift), escalator, moving walkway, etc.

      NOTE&nbsp; More detailed equipment that may be a part of a
      transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as
      <em>IfcDiscreteAccessory</em>. It maybe included as a part of
      the <em>IfcTransportElement</em> by virtue of the objectified
      relationship <em>IfcRelAggregates</em>.

      Depending on local classification systems transport elements
      and transportation systems in buildings are either considered
      as part of a building system, or as part of a building
      service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a
      building system and may have to be mapped appropriately.
