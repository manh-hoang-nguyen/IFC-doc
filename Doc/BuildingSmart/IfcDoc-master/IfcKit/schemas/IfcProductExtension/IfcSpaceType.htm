<p>A space represents an area or volume bounded actually or theoretically. Spaces are areas or volumes that provide for certain functions within a building.</p>
<p>The <em>IfcSpaceType</em> defines a list of commonly shared defines commonly shared information for occurrences of spaces. The set of shared information may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>common properties within shared property sets
      </li>
      <li>common shape representations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is used to define an space specification (i.e. the
      specific space information, that is common to all occurrences
      of that space type. Space types may be exchanged without
      being already assigned to occurrences.

      NOTE&nbsp; The space types are often used to represent
      space catalogues, less so for sharing a common representation
      map. Space types in a space catalogue share same space
      classification and a common set of space requirement
      properties.
