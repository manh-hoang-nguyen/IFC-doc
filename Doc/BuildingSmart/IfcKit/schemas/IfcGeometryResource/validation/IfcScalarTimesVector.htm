This function returns the vector that is the scalar multiple of the input
vector. It accepts as input a scalar and a 'vector' which may be either
a Direction or a Vector. The output is a Vector of the same units as
the input vector or unitless if a direction is input. If either input
argument is undefined then the returned vector is also undefined.</blockquote>
