<p>An advanced B-rep is a boundary representation model in which all faces, edges and vertices are explicitly represented. It is a solid with explicit topology and elementary or free-form geometry. The faces of the B-rep are of type <em>IfcAdvancedFace</em>. An advanced B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints as the manifold solid B-rep.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The advanced B-rep has been introduced in order to support the increasing number of applications that can define and exchange B-rep models based on NURBS or other b-spline surfaces.</blockquote>

The diagram shows the topological and geometric representation items that are used for advanced B-reps, based on <em>IfcAdvancedFace</em>. It shows the use of <em>IfcIntersectionCurve</em> to provide the geometric representation of the edge curve both as 3D curve and as u,v pcurve in the parametric space of the adjacent surfaces.</p>
