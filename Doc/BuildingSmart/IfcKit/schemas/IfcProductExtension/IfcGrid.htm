    <p>
      <em>IfcGrid</em> ia a planar design grid defined in 3D space
      used as an aid in locating structural and design elements.
      The position of the grid (<em>ObjectPlacement</em>) is defined
      by a 3D coordinate system (and thereby the design grid can be
      used in plan, section or in any position relative to the
      world coordinate system). The position can be relative to the
      object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of
      the 3D coordinate system is used to place the grid axes,
      which are 2D curves (for example, line, circle, arc,
      polyline).
    </p>
    <p>
      The inherited attributes <em>Name</em> and <em>Description</em>
      can be used to define a descriptive name of the grid and to
      indicate the grid's purpose. A grid is defined by (normally)
      two, or (in case of a triangular grid) three lists of grid
      axes. The following figures shows some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grid may support a rectangular layout as shown in Figure 5, a radial
      layout as shown in Figure 6, or a triangular layout as shown in Figure 7.
