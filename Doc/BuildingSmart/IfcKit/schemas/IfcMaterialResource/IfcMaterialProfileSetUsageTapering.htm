<p class="use-head">Usage with tapered building elements</p>
<p>The inherited attribute <em>ForProfileSet</em> specifies the
profile and material at the start of the member,
<em>ForProfileEndSet</em> at its end. Start and end correspond to
the extrusion direction in the shape model of the shape
representation of the element or element type.</p>
<p>Both material profile sets should refer to the same material,
that is, only differ with respect to their profiles.</p>

<p class="use-head">Usage with structural analysis curve members</p>
<p><em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering</em> may be used with the
structural analysis idealization
(<em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em>) of uniform members as well as
of tapered members.</p>
<p>In case of uniform members, <em>ForProfileSet</em> and
<em>ForProfileEndSet</em> refer to the same material profile set.
In case of tapered members, <em>ForProfileSet</em> specifies the
profile and material at the start of the member,
<em>ForProfileEndSet</em> at its end. Start and end correspond to
the edge direction in the topological representation of the curve
member.</p>
