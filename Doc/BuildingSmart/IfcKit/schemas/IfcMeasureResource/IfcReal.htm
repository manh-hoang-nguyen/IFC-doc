<p><em>IfcReal</em> is a defined type of simple data type REAL.  It is required since a select type (<em>IfcSimpleValue</em>), cannot directly include simple types in its select list.</p>

<p>In principle, the domain of <em>IfcReal</em> (being a Real) is all rational, irrational and scientific real numbers. Here the precision is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.</p>

<p>Type: REAL</p>
