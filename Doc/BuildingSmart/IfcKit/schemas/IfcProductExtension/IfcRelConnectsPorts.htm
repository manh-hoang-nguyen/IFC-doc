    <p>
      An <em>IfcRelConnectsPorts</em> relationship defines the
      relationship that is made between two ports at their point of
      connection. It may include the connection geometry between
      two ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objectified relationship <em>IfcRelConnectsPorts</em> is
      required for defining how two instances of <em>IfcPort</em>
      connect together. Each of the ports is logically contained
      within the <em>IfcDistributionElement</em> by using the ordered
      collection <em>IfcRelNests</em>.

      IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Previously the containment of the <em>IfcPort</em> within the <em>IfcDistributionElement</em>
      had been realized using the <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> relationship.
