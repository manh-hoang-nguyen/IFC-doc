      The <em>IfcExtendedProperties</em> is an abstract supertype
      of all extensible property collections that are applicable to
      certain characterized entities. Instantiable subtypes of
      <em>IfcExtendedProperties</em> assign the property
      collection to a particular characterized entity.

      Instantiable subtypes have a set of <em>Properties</em>, each
      providing property name, value and unit and other instance
      information, depending on the subtype of IfcProperty
      referenced.
