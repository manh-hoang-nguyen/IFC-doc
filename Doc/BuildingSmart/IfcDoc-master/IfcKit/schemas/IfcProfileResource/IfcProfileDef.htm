<p><em>IfcProfileDef</em>
is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles
within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used
section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross
  sections by a description of its parameters.</li>
  <li>Arbitrary profiles are cross
  sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also
  include holes, defined by inner boundaries.</li>
  <li>Derived profiles, based on a
  transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile
  definitions available.</li>
  <li>In addition composite
  profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions
  to define the resulting profile.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="history">
HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x.
Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with
inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.

<blockquote class="change-ifc2x4">
IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not
require an explicitly defined geometry.  Added inverse attributes <em>HasProperties</em> and <em>HasExternalReference</em>.

<p><b>Use in material association</b></p>

<p>Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may
be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition,
by means of <em>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</em> together with <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em>
and <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em>. This way, building elements and element types
with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and
association.</p>

<p>The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with
shape representations of the respective building elements.</p>

<p>A higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member
(such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided
within <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> by means of a cardinal point reference.
This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.</p>


<p><b>Use in shape models</b></p>

<p>Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model
resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or
sectioned spines.</p>

<p>The purpose of the profile
definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define
a uniform cross section being swept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>along a line (extrusion) using <em>IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion</em> or <em>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</em></li>
  <li>along a circular arc (revolution) using <em>IfcSurfaceOfRevolution</em> or <em>IfcRevolvedAreaSolid</em></li>
  <li>along a directrix lying on a reference surface using <em>IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the profile
definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross
sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype <em>IfcDerivedProfileDef</em>
is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based
on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the
identity of vertices and edges.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the <em>IfcProfileDef</em>
contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>)
which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given
by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two
special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a
2D Cartesian transformation.
</blockquote>

<p>An <em>IfcProfileDef</em>
is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In
this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The
attribute <em>ProfileType</em> is set to AREA. An <em>IfcProfileDef</em>
is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this
case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of
the profile. The attribute <em>ProfileType</em>
is set to CURVE.</p>

<p><u>Sweeping</u></p>

<p>In the later use of the <em>IfcProfileDef</em>
within the swept surface or swept area solid,&nbsp; e.g. the <em>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</em>
(here used as an example), the profile boundaries (here based on the 2D
position coordinate system of <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>)
are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of
the swept surface or swept area solid.</p>

<p>The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>directly in case of using <em>IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef</em>
        and <em>IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef</em>,</li>

        <li>through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of
        using <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>.</li>

        <li>through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator (applied directly
        to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions,
        or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized
        profile definitions) in case of using <em>IfcDerivedProfileDef</em>.</li>

        <li>when using <em>IfcCompositeProfileDef</em> the insertion depends on
        the subtype of the included sub-profiles.</li>

<p><b>Profile types</b></p>

<p>Results of the different usage of the <em>ProfileType</em> attribute are demonstrated here. The <em>ProfileType</em> defines whether the inside (the bounded area) is part of the profile definition (Area) or not (Curve). Figure 4 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on <em>ProfileType</em>.</p>

<p><b>Profile specification by external reference</b></p>

<p>If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference
to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of <em>HasExternalReference</em>.
This inverse relationship is used to associate an <em>IfcExternalReference</em> (notably
<em>IfcClassificationReference</em> or <em>IfcLibraryReference</em>) with the
profile.</p>

<p><em>IfcClassificationReference</em> is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or
manufacturer's standard).  In this case,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcClassificationReference.Identification</em>
contains the formal profile designation from the norm.
(On the other hand, <em>IfcProfileDef.ProfileName</em> contains a displayable name which may
not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)</li>
<li><em>IfcClassificationReference.Name</em> carries the short name of the profile norm.</li>
<li>Optionally, the norm can be further described by
<em>IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>IfcLibraryReference</em> is used to refer to a library which contains profile
definitions. In this case,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcLibraryReference.Identification</em> contains the identifier of the
profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to
<em>IfcProfileDef.ProfileName</em> which should be human-readable).</li>
<li><em>IfcLibraryReference.Location</em> and <em>.Name</em> or <em>.ReferencedLibrary</em>
further describe the library.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that
the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the
referenced classification or library.</p>



<p><b>Direct instances of <em>IfcProfileDef</em></b></p>

<p>Usually, only subtypes of <em>IfcProfileDef</em> should be instantiated.
In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes
other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be
possible to directly instantiate <em>IfcProfileDef</em> and further specify
the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter
are tracked by the inverse attribute <em>HasProperties</em>.</p>
