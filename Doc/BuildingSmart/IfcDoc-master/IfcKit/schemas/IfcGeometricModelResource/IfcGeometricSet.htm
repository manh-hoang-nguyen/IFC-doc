    <p>
      The <em>IfcGeometricSet</em> is used for the exchange of
      shape representation consisting of (2D or 3D) points,
      curves, and surfaces, which do not have a topological
      structure (such as connected face sets or shells), are
      not tessellated and are not solid models (such as swept 
      solids, CSG or Brep).
