<p>The standard member, <em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em>, defines a member with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The <em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em> handles all cases of members, that:</p>
<ul>
 <li>have a reference to the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> defining the material profile association of the member with the cardinal point of its insertion relative to the local placement.</li>
 <li>are based on a sweep of a planar profile, or set of profiles, as defined by the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em></li>
 <li>have an 'Axis' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition</li>
 <li>have a 'Body' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition</li>
 <li>have a start profile, or set of profiles, that is swept along the directrix and might be changed uniformly by a taper definition</li>
 <li>are consistent in using the correct cardinal point offset of the profile as compared to the 'Axis' and 'Body' shape representation</li>
 <li>are extruded perpendicular to the profile definition plane</li>
</ul>

NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, such as by excluding tapering from an <em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em> implementation.
