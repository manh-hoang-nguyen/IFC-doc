<p>A stair flight is an assembly of building components in a single "run" of stair steps (not interrupted by a landing). The stair steps and any stringers are
included in the stair flight. A winder is also regarded a part of a stair flight.</p>

<p>An <em>IfcStairFlight</em> is normally aggregated by an <em>IfcStair</em> through the <em>IfcRelAggregates</em> relationship, the stair flight is then included in the set of <em>IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects</em>. An <em>IfcStairFlight</em> normally connects the floor slab of zero to two different storeys
(or partial storeys, or landings) within a building. The connection relationship between the <em>IfcStairFlight</em> and the <em>IfcSlab</em> can be expressed using the <em>IfcRelConnectsElements</em> relationship.</p>
