<p>An <em>IfcConic</em> is a parameterized planar curve.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A conic is a planar curve which could be produced by intersecting a plane with a cone. A conic is defined in terms of
its intrinsic geometric properties rather than being described in terms of other geometry. A conic entity always has a
placement coordinate system defined by axis2_placement; the parametric representation is defined in terms of this
placement coordinate system.</blockquote>
