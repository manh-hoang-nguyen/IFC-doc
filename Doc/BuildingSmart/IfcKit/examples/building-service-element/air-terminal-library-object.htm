<p>
This example includes a library file containing an air terminal type. It explains how type definitions can be included from an external library. 
</p>
<p>
The air terminal type consists of a single port, with property sets defined on the type and port. Figure 506 illustrates the air 
terminal type, where a green arrow indicates the port, placed at the arrow head.
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
  NOTE&nbsp; The arrow head is not part of the exchange, only the port definition. Viewers may represent ports in different ways.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The property sets have backing templates from an external library file.
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
  Standard property sets (defined within this specification) do not require templates to be included; they are
  shown in this example for illustration, such as if custom property sets were to be used.
