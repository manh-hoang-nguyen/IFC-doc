      NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
      A faceted B-rep is a simple form of boundary representation
      model in which all faces are planar and all edges are
      straight lines. Unlike the B-rep model, edges and vertices
      are not represented explicitly in the model but are
      implicitly available through the poly loop entity. A faceted
      B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints as the
      manifold solid B-rep.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="extDef">
      The faceted B-rep has been introduced in order to support the
      larger number of systems that allow boundary type solid
      representations with planar surfaces only.
