<p>An <em>IfcSurface</em> is a 2-dimensional representation item positioned in 3-dimensional space. 2-dimensional means that each point at the surface can be defined by a 2-dimensional coordinate system, usually by u and v coordinates.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A surface can be envisioned as a set of connected points in 3-dimensional space which is always locally 2-dimensional, but need not be a manifold.<br>
Each surface has a parametric representation of the form</blockquote>
