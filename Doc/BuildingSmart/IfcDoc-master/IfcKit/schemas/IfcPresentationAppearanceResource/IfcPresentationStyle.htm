<p>The <em>IfcPresentationStyle</em> is an abstract generalization of style
table for presentation information assigned to geometric representation items.
It includes styles for curves, areas, surfaces, and text. Style information may
include colour, hatching, rendering, and text fonts.</p>
<p>The different styles may include length measures (directly as a length
measure with infered unit, or indirectly as a ratio in relation to another
length measure). They may apply to curve pattern, hatch line distances, text
spacing and font sizes. The attribute <em>ModelOrDraughting</em> determines
whether those length measures are provided as model or draughting measures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model measures, also called scale dependent measures, define the distance,
size or other length measures as being always the same in model space and the
distance size or other length measures on paper depend on the plotting
scale.</li>
<li>Draughting measures, also called scale independent measures, define the
distance , size or other length measures as being always the same, when plotted
on paper, independent of the plot scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subtype of&nbsp; <em>IfcPresentationStyle</em> is assigned to the
<em>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</em>'s through an intermediate
<em>IfcStyledItem</em>.</p>
