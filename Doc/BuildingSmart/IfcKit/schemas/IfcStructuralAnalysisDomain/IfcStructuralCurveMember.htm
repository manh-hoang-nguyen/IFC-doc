<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>See definitions at <em>IfcStructuralItem</em>.  The local coordinate system is established by the reference curve given by topology representation and by the attribute <em>Axis</em>.  The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the reference curve.  The local z axis is located in the surface which is created by sweeping <em>Axis</em> along the reference curve and is directed according to <em>Axis</em>.  The local y axis is directed such that x,y,z form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.</p>
