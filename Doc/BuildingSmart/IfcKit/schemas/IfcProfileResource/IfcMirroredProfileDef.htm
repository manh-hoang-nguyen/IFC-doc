<p>The <em>IfcMirroredProfileDef</em> defines the profile by mirroring the parent profile about the y axis of the parent profile coordinate system. That is, left and right of the parent profile are swapped.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p><em>IfcMirroredProfileDef</em> is primarily useful together with
<em>IfcCShapeProfileDef</em>, <em>IfcLShapeProfileDef</em>,
<em>IfcUShapeProfileDef</em>, or <em>IfcZShapeProfileDef</em> as
parent profile but can be used with other parent profile types as well.</p>

<p>Mirroring of an <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em> is performed after
translation and rotation according to its <em>Position</em> attribute.
For example, if the parent profile's <em>Position</em> offsets it by half
of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by
half of its width to the left.</p>

<p>Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be
achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation
about the z axis.
In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as
<em>IfcSweptAreaSolid</em>, i.e. after mirroring by <em>IfcMirroredProfileDef</em>
was performed.
If the parent profile is an <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>, rotation
can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its
<em>Position</em> attribute, i.e. before mirroring by <em>IfcMirroredProfileDef</em>
was performed.</p>
