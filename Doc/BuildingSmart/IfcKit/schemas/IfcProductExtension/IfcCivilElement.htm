<p>An <em>IfcCivilElement</em> is a generalization of all elements within a civil engineering works. It includes in particular all occurrences of typical linear construction works, such as road segments, bridge segments, pavements, etc. Depending on the context of the construction project, included building work, such as buildings or factories, are represented as a collection of <em>IfcBuildingElement</em>'s, distribution systems, such as piping or drainage, are represented as a collection of <em>IfcDistributionElement</em>'s, and other geographic elements, such as trees, light posts, traffic signs etc. are represented as <em>IfcGeographicElement</em>'s.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcCivilElement</em> has been intruduced as a stub for future extensions of this specification 
to include an object model for civil engineering works.</blockquote>

<p>Civil elements are typically horizontally organized using a spatial structure expressed by spatial zones, therefore <em>IfcCivilElement</em> is spatially contained by default within an <em>IfcSpatialZone</em>.
