 


<p>An <em>IfcDocumentReference</em> is a reference 
to the location of a document. The reference is given by a system 
interpretable <em>Location</em> attribute (a URL string) where the document can be found, and an optional inherited
 internal reference <em>Identification</em>, which refers to a system
 interpretable position within the document. The optional inherited
<em>Name</em> attribute is meant to have meaning for human readers. Optional 
document metadata can also be captured through reference to 
<em>IfcDocumentInformation</em>.</p>
