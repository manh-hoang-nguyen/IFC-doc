<p>This example illustrates a framed wall with openings suitable for a door and window. </p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The example wall is very typical of residential construction in the U.S., consisting of "2x4" framing with gypsum panels on each side.</blockquote>

<p>The wall has three layers: forward-facing drywall, framing, and rear-facing drywall. Each of these layers are modeled as <i>IfcMaterialLayer</i> and have corresponding parts which elaborate each into elements. 
Geometry for items makes use of <i>IfcMappedItem</i> for efficiency in storage and processing, such that a mesh for each shape need only be instantiated once, and then transformed multiple times.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'Axis' representation of the wall indicates the parametric path for which the component geometry is generated.</li>
<li>The 'Body' representations of the components is derived from the defined types, the axis path, and the order of the layer as defined by the material layer set.</li>
<li>The 'Surface' representation of the wall is derived from the boundaries of the component geometry.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The particular rules defining layout of components of framed walls are out of scope of this specification.</blockquote>

<p>The example in Figure 500 shows the solid representation of the elemented wall, the example in Figure 501 shows the same elemented wall in transparent mode.</p>
