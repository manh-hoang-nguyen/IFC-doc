/*Global units within a project could also be given as derived units (although the use of standard SI units
is encouraged). In this case the IfcUnitAssignment should refer to the derived unit definition, given by
the unit type, a name and the conversion rate in regard to the SI units for the same unit type.
The ValueComponent of the IfcMeasureWithUnit that is used as ConversionFactor should given the
amount of the base units, that equals 1 conversion based unit.
Examples
 IfcConversionBasedUnit = “Inch” – ValueComponent of ConversionFactor = 25.40005
 IfcConversionBasedUnit = “Degree” – ValueComponent of ConversionFactor =
0.0174532926
If degrees should be used for plane angle measures, in contrary to the example above (i.e. 180’
instead of 3.1416, or π), than it has to be declared as a derived unit, referring to the radian as the
underlying SI unit.*/
