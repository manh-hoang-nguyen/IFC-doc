<p>The schema <em>IfcPresentationOrganizationResource</em> defines the resources used for geometric representations and presentations of styled items. The primary application of this resource is for presenting the annotation occurrences of curve, text, filled area, symbol, and surfaces. The organization resource focusses on the provision of layer assignments and light objects.</p>

<p>The following is within the scope of the presentation resource schemas:</p>
<ul>
 <li>definition of presentation style attributes for realistic and symbolic visualizations of geometric and non-geometric displayble elements in the product information, including presentation styles for
  <ul class="inner">
   <li>curve</li>
   <li>text</li>
   <li>filled area</li>
   <li>surface</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>support of curve styles;</li>
 <li>support of externally defined character fonts and symbols;</li>
 <li>support of pre defined character fonts and symbols;</li>
 <li>support of surface rendering and lighting properties;</li>
 <li>support of textures aüülied to surfaces and csg primitives;</li>
 <li>image control by a layer mechanism.</li>
</ul>
