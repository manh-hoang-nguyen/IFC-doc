<p><em>IfcShapeAspect</em> allows for grouping of shape representation items
that represent aspects (or components) of the shape of a product. Thereby shape
representations of components of the product shape represent a distinctive part
to a product that can be explicitly addressed.</p>
<p>The <em>IfcShapeAspect</em>'s may have distinct material information or
other distict characteristics that differs from other parts of the product
shape representation.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcShapeAspect</em> together with
the <em>IfcMaterialConstituent</em> can be used to associate distict material
information to parts of the product shape representation.</blockquote>
<p>Figure 2 indicates the association of material characteristics to shape
aspects.</p>
