<p>The schema <em>IfcStructuralElementsDomain</em> provides the ability to represent different kinds of building elements and building element parts which in general are of structural nature. In addition to generally used building elements already defined in the <em>IfcSharedBuildingElements</em> schema, the schema contains entities for representing foundation parts, such as footings and piles, as well as some important structural subparts included in other building elements, such as different kinds of explicit reinforcement parts, and manufactured features and treatments.</p>
