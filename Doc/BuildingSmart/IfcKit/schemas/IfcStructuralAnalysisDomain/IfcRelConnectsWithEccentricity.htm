<p>The entity <em>IfcRelConnectsWithEccentricity</em> adds the definition of eccentricity to the connection between a structural member and a structural connection (representing either a node or support).</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Another eccentricity model is available independently of eccentric connection specification:  The section profile of a curve member may be inserted eccentrically with respect to the member's reference curve, see definitions at <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em>.  Whether one or the other or both eccentricity models may be used is subject to information requirements and local agreements.
