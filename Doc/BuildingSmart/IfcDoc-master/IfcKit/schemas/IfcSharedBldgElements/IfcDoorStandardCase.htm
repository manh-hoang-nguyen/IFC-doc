<p>The standard door, <em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em>, defines a door
with certain constraints for the provision of operation types,
opening directions, frame and lining parameters, and with certain
constraints for the geometric representation. The
<em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em> handles all cases of doors, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are inserted into an opening, represented by
<em>IfcOpeningElement</em>, using the <em>IfcRelFillsElement</em>
relationship;</li>
<li>have a local placement relative to this opening, and with the
y-axis of the placement pointing into the opening direction;</li>
<li>have a profile geometry, represented by
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</em>="Profile" as
a closed curve to which the door parameters apply;</li>
<li>have a reference to an <em>IfcDoorType</em> to define the opening
direction and the operation type (swinging, sliding, folding, etc.)
of the door. The attribute <em>OperationType</em> shall be provided
and not being UNDEFINED, and the attribute
<em>ParameterTakesPrecedence</em> shall be "TRUE";</li>
<li>have an <em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and
<em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> instances included in the set of
<em>HasPropertySets</em> at <em>IfcDoorType</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><em>Geometric Representations</em></b></p>
<p>The geometric representation of <em>IfcDoorStandardCase</em> is
defined using the following multiple shape representations for its
definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Profile</u>: a three-dimensional closed curve within a
particular shape representation. The profile is used to apply the
parameter of the parametric door representation. The profile around
the edges of the opening is used to apply the door lining and door
panel shape parameter.</li>
<li><u>MappedRepresentation</u>: A SweptSolid, SurfaceModel, Brep
or a CSG representation additionally defining the 3D shape of the
standard door in addition to the parametric representation by
applying the <em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and an the
<em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> to the 'Profile' representation.</li>
</ul>
