<p>The <em>IfcCartesianPointList2D</em> defines an ordered collection of two-dimentional Cartesian points. Each Cartesian point is provided as an two-dimensional point by a fixed list of two coordinates. The attribute <em>CoordList</em> is a two-dimensional list, where</p>
<ul>
 <li>first dimension is an unbounded list representing each 2D Cartesian point;</li>
 <li>second dimension is a fixed list of two list members, where [1] is the x-coordinate, and [2] the y-coordinate of the Cartesian point.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcCartesianPointList2D</em> is introduced to provide a compact representation of larger list of points, such as in indexable representation of points used as vertices in poly curves.</blockquote>
