<p><em>IfcInteger</em> is a defined type of simple data type Integer. It is required since a select type (<em>IfcSimpleValue</em>) cannot include directly simple types in its select list.</p>

<p>In principle, the domain of <em>IfcInteger</em> (being an Integer) is all integer numbers. Here the number of bits used for the <em>IfcInteger</em> representation is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.</p>

<p>Type: INTEGER</p>
