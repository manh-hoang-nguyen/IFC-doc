<p>The <em>IfcProductDefinitionShape</em> defines all shape relevant information about an <em>IfcProduct</em>. It allows for multiple geometric shape representations of the same product. The shape relevant information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the shape representation including geometric representation items (for 3D solids, 2D annotations, etc.) and:
<ul>
<li>associated presentation information (line color, line type, surface rendering properties)</li>
<li>assignment to presentation layers (CAD layers for visibility control)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>or the topological representation items for connectivity systems (vertex, edge, face representations) that may include geometric representation items (vertex points, edge curves, face surfaces)</li>
</ul>
