<p>The objectified relationship <em>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</em> handles the assignment of one or many objects to a process or activity. An object can be a product that is the item the process operates on. Processes and activities can operate on things other than products, and can operate in ways other than input and output.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; It may be common to define processes
during estimating or scheduling that describe design tasks
(resulting in documents), procurement tasks (resulting in
construction materials), planning tasks (resulting in processes),
etc. Furthermore, the ways in which process can operate on
something might include "installs", "finishes", "transports",
"removes", etc. The ways are described as operation
types.
</blockquote>

<p>The inherited attribute <em>RelatedObjects</em> gives the
references to the objects, or object type, which the process
operates on. The <em>RelatingProcess</em> is the process or process
type, that operates on the object. The operation types are
captured in the inherited attribute <em>Name</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The agreement on valid and recognizable
values for the <em>Name</em> attribute is part of view definitions
and implementer agreements.
