<p>The objectified relationship
<em>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</em> handles the assignment of a
classification item (items of the select
<em>IfcClassificationSelect</em>) to objects occurrences (subtypes of
<em>IfcObject</em>) or object types (subtypes of
<em>IfcTypeObject</em>).</p>
<p>The relationship is used to assign a classification item, or a
classification system itself to objects. Depending on the type of
the <em>RelatingClassification</em> it is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference to an classification item within an external
classification system, or</li>
<li>a reference to the classification system itself</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The reference to a classification item
includes a link to the classification system within which the item
is declared. It assigns the meaning of the classification item to
the object (ocurrence or type). The reference to the classification
system provides the information that the object (occurrence or
type) is governed by the classification system but no assignment of
a particular items has been done yet.
</blockquote>

<p>The inherited attribute <em>RelatedObjects</em> define the objects
or object types to which the classification is applied. The
attribute <em>RelatingClassification</em> is the reference to a
classification, applied to the object(s). A single
<em>RelatingClassification</em> can thereby be applied to one or
multiple objects.</p>
