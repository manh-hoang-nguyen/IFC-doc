<p>An <em>IfcCartesianTransformationOperator</em> defines a geometric transformation in three-dimensional space.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A Cartesian transformation operator 3d defines a geometric transformation in three-dimensional space composed of
translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an
orthogonal matrix <b>T</b>. These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and axis3 by the base
axis function. If |<b>T</b>|= -1, the transformation includes mirroring.</blockquote>
