<p>Identification of people and equipment of a crew is achieved through their specification at the level of the component. Therefore, knowing which persons are within a crew is achieved through identifying the persons assigned to each <em>IfcLaborResource</em> within the <em>IfcCrewResource</em>.  Similarly, identifying that a screwing machine for pipe fitting forms part of the crew is achieved by relating an appropriate instance of <em>IfcElementComponent</em> to the <em>IfcConstructionEquipmentResource</em> forming an element of the <em>IfcCrewResource</em>.</p>
