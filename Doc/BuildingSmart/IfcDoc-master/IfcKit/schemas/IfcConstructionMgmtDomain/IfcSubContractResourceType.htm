<p>The resource type <em>IfcSubContractResourceType</em> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of subcontract resources. The set of shared information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common productivities</li>
<li>common cost rates</li>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to define a subcontract resource specification (the specific resource information that is common to all
occurrences of that resource). Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcSubContractResourceType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcSubContractResource</em>.</p>
