<p><em>IfcObjectPlacement</em> is an abstract supertype for the special types defining the object coordinate system. The
<em>IfcObjectPlacement</em> has to be provided for each product that has a shape representation.</p>
<p>The object placement can be given:</p>
<ul>
<li>absolute: by an axis2 placement, relative to the world coordinate system,</li>
<li>relative: by an axis2 placement, relative to the object placement of another product,</li>
<li>by grid reference: by the virtual intersection and reference direction given by two axes of a design grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case the object placement has to unambiguously define the object coordinate system as either two-dimensional axis placement (<em>IfcAxis2Placement2D</em>) or three-dimensional axis placement (<em>IfcAxis2Placement3D</em>). The axis placement may have to be calculated.</p>
