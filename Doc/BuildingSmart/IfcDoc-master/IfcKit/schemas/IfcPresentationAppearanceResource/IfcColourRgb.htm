NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-46:1992<br>
A colour rgb as a subtype of colour specifications is defined by three colour component values for red, green, and blue in the RGB colour model.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; In contrary to the usual value range of colour components being integer from 0...255, the definition from ISO10303-46 defines the colour components as real from 0.0 ... 1.0. Applications need to execute this conversion before populating the colour RGB values.
