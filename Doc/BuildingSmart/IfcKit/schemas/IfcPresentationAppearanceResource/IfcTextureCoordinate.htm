<p>The <em>IfcTextureCoordinate</em> is an abstract supertype of the different kinds to apply texture coordinates to
geometries. For vertex based geometries an explicit assignment of 2D texture vertices to the 3D geometry points
is supported by the subtype <em>IfcTextureMap</em>, in addition there can be a procedural description of how texture
coordinates shall be applied to geometric items. If no <em>IfcTextureCoordinate</em> is provided for the
<em>IfcSurfaceTexture</em>, the default mapping shall be used.
