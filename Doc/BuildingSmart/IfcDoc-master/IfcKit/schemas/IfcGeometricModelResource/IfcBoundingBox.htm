<p>The <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> defines an orthogonal box oriented parallel to the axes of the object coordinate system
in which it is defined. It is defined by a <em>Corner</em> being a three-dimensional Cartesian point and three length
measures defining the X, Y and Z parameters of the box in the direction of the positive axes.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Any subtype of <em>IfcProduct</em> having a product shape representation may have a
bounding box representation. The 'Box' representation identifier defined at IfcShapeRepresentation utilizes the
<em>IfcBoundingBox</em> as the simpliest 3D shape representation.</blockquote>

<p class="small">As shown in Figure 2, the <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> is defined with its own location which can be used to place the
<em>IfcBoundingBox</em> relative to the geometric coordinate system. The <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> is defined by the
lower left corner (<em>Corner</em>) and the upper right corner (<em>XDim, YDim, ZDim</em> measured within the parent
co-ordinate system).</p>
