<p>A system is an organized combination of related parts within an AEC product, composed for a common purpose or function or to provide a service. A system is essentially a functionally related aggregation of products. The grouping relationship to one or several instances of <em>IfcProduct</em> (the system members) is handled by <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The use of <em>IfcSystem</em> often applies to the representation of building services related systems, such as the piping system, cold water system, etc. Members within such a system may or may not be connected using the connectivity related entities (through <em>IfcDistributionPort</em>).</blockquote>
