<p>The <em>IfcElementAssemblyType</em>
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an
element and an optional set of product representations. It is
used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific
product information, that is common to all occurrences of that
product type).</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined
as representation maps (at the level of the supertype
<em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
occurrence instance through the
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
<em>IfcMappedItem</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>An element assembly type is used to define the common
properties of a certain type of an element assembly that may be
applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific
style. An element assembly types (or the instantiable subtypes)
may be exchanged without being already assigned to
occurrences.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcElementAssemblyType</em> are
represented by instances of <em>IfcElementAssembly</em>.</p>
