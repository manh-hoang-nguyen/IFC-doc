      The <em>IfcSpatialZoneType</em>
      defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of
      a space and an optional set of product representations. It is
      used to define a space specification (i.e. the specific space
      information, that is common to all occurrences of that space
      type).

      NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined
        as representation maps (at the level of the supertype
        <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
        occurrence instance through the
        <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
        <em>IfcMappedItem</em>.

      A spatial zone type is used to define the common properties
      of a certain type of space that may be applied to many
      instances of that type to assign a specific style. Space
      types may be exchanged without being already assigned to
      occurrences.

      NOTE&nbsp; The spatial zone types are often used to
        represent space catalogues, less so for sharing a common
        representation map. Spatial zone types in a space catalogue
        share same space classification and a common set of space
        requirement properties.
