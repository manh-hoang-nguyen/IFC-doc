<p>The standard plate,
<em>IfcPlateStandardCase</em>, defines a plate with certain
constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and
with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The
<em>IfcPlateStandardCase</em> handles all cases of plates, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a reference to the <em>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</em>
defining the material layers of the plate with thicknesses</li>
<li>are based on an extrusion of a planar surface as defined by the
plate profile</li>
<li>have a constant thickness along the extrusion direction</li>
<li>are consistent in using the correct material layer set offset
to the base planar surface in regard to the shape
representation</li>
<li>are extruded perpendicular to the plane surface</li>
</ul>
<p>The definitions of plate openings and niches are the same as
given at the supertype <em>IfcPlate</em>. The same agreements to the
special types of plates, as defined in the <em>PredefinedType</em>
attribute apply as well.</p>
