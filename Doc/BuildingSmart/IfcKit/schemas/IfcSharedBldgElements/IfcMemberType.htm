<p>The element type
<em>IfcMemberType</em> defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of members. Members are predominately linear building
elements, often forming part of a structural system. The
orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped)
is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to beam and
column). The set of shared information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common profile definitions</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to define a member specification, or member style
(the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that member type). Member types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcMemberType</em> within building models
are represented by instances of <em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em> if
the <em>IfcMemberType</em> has a single associated
<em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em>; otherwise they are represented by
instances of <em>IfcMember</em>. Occurrences of the
<em>IfcMemberType</em> within structural analysis models are
represented by instances of <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em>, or
its applicable subtypes.</p>
