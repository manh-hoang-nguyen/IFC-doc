<p>The entity <em>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</em> is used to structure the
physical impacts.  By using the grouping features inherited from <em>IfcGroup</em>, instances of
<em>IfcStructuralAction</em> (or its subclasses) and of <em>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</em> can be used to
define load groups, load cases and load combinations.  (See also <em>IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum</em>.)</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Important functionality for the description of a load-bearing system
is derived from the existing IFC entity <em>IfcGroup</em>.  This class provides, via the relationship
class <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</em>, the needed grouping mechanism.  In this way, instances of
<em>IfcStructuralAction</em> belonging to a specific load group can be unambiguously determined.

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The relationship class <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</em> is
used to group load cases into load combinations.  The factor provided in this assignment relationship
is to applied together with the optional <em>IfcStructuralLoadGroup.Coefficient</em>.  Unlike this
coefficient which always affects the load group, the <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor.Factor</em> is
specific for a load case&mdash;load combination pair.  As many instances of
<em>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</em> are used within one load combination as there are different
<em>Factor</em>s to be applied to load cases in the load combination.
On the other hand, a load case may appear in more than one load combination
and can have a different <em>Factor</em> in each assignment by <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</em>.
