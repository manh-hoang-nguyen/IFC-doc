<p>This schema defines the representation of shape and topology as important definitional properties for products defined within the IFC Object Model. The representations characterize certain properties of a product, and any product can be defined by zero, one, or many of those properties. The schema defines two ways to represent definitional properties of products:</p>

<ul>
 <li>topological representation </li>
 <li>geometric shape representation </li>
</ul>
<p>The geometric shape representation allows for </p>
<ul>
 <li>multiple shape representations for the same product definition shape of a product </li>
 <li>separate shape representations for components or parts of the product definition shape by using shape aspects </li>
</ul>
