<p>The standard window,
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em>, defines a window with certain
constraints for the provision of operation types, opening
directions, frame and lining parameters, construction types and
with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The
<em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em> handles all cases of windows,
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are inserted into an opening, represented by
<em>IfcOpeningElement</em>, using the <em>IfcRelFillsElement</em>
relationship</li>
<li>have a local placement relative to this opening, and with the
y-axis of the placement pointing into the opening direction</li>
<li>have a profile geometry, represented by
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier</em>="Profile"
as a closed curve to which the window parameter apply. The
profile represents a rectangle within the xz plane of the local
placement</li>
<li>have a reference to an <em>IfcWindowType</em> to define the
opening direction and the operation type (swinging, sliding,
folding, etc.) of the window. The attribute <em>OperationType</em>
shall be provided and not being UNDEFINED, and the attribute
<em>ParameterTakesPrecedence</em> shall be "TRUE".</li>
<li>have a single <em>IfcWindowLiningProperties</em> and a set of
<em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> instances included in the set of
<em>HasPropertySets</em> at <em>IfcWindowType</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The geometric representation of <em>IfcWindowStandardCase</em>
is defined using the following multiple shape representations for
its definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Profile</u>: a three-dimensional closed curve within a
particular shape representation. The profile is used to apply the
parameter of the parametric window representation. The profile
around the edges of the opening is used to apply the window
lining and window panel shape parameter.</li>
<li><u>Body</u>: A SweptSolid, SurfaceModel, or
Brep Representation or a CSG additionally defining the 3D shape
of the standard window in addition to the parametric
representation by applying the <em>IfcWindowLiningProperties</em>
and an the <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> to the Profile
representation.</li>
</ul>
