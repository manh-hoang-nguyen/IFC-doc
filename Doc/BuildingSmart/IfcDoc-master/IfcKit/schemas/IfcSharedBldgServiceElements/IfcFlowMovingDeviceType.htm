	
<p>The element type <em>IfcFlowMovingDeviceType</em> defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow moving device and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow moving device specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	     
<p>A flow moving type is used to define the common properties of a flow moving device that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow moving device is a device that is used to produce a pressure differential in a distribution system, such as a pump, fan, or compressor.  Flow moving types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcFlowMovingDeviceType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcFlowMovingDevice</em> or its subtypes.</p>
