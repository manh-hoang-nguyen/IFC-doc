<p>The <em>IfcTriangulatedFaceSet</em> is a tessellated face set with all faces being bound by triangles. The faces are constructed by implicit polylines defined by three Cartesian points. Depending on the value of the attribute <em>Closed</em> the instance of <em>IfcTriangulatedFaceSet</em> represents:</p>
<ul>
 <li>if TRUE, a boundary represention (or B-rep);</li>
 <li>if FALSE, a face based surface representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The coordinates of each point are provided by a one-based index into an ordered list of Cartesian points provided by the two-dimensional list <em>CoordIndex</em>, where</p>
<ul>
 <li>the first dimension of the two-dimensional list addresses the list of triangular faces;</li>
 <li>the second dimension of the two-dimensional list provides exactly three indices. Each index points to a Cartesian point being a vertex of the triangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the provision of <i>PnIndex</i> the indices point either directly into the <em>IfcCartesianPointList3D</em> referenced by <i>Coordinates</i> defined at the supertype <em>IfcTessellatedFaceSet</em>, or they point into the <i>PnIndex</i> where the integer values at that position provides the location of the coordinate values within the <em>IfcCartesianPointList3D</em>. See Figure 5 for the handling of point index.</p>

<p>Optionally normals can be provided. Only normals per vector are supported allowing for visually curved triangles when the three normals of the corresponding three vertices of a triangle are not co-linear to the normal of the triangular face. If they are identical, normals shall be omited.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; In case of a body representation having triangular faces with curvature, different normals for all three vertices in context of this triangles are exported, describing the curvature for smooth visualisation. In case of triangular faces with no curvature, the three vertex-based normals are identical and could always be computed from the face. Therefore vertices should only be exported to support smooth visualisation by curvature of triangles. In case of faceted representation no vertices should be exported.</blockquote>

<p>Normals are provided by the two-dimensional list <i>Normals</i>, where</p>
<ul>
 <li>the first dimension of the two-dimensional list addresses the corresponding list of vertex indices of the triangular faces;
</li>
 <li>the second dimension of the two-dimensional list provides exactly three real values to determine the direction of the normal at this vertex of the triangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The indices in the <i>CoordIndex</i> point into the list of <i>Normals</i>. The indices of <i>CoordIndex</i> are applied to both points, either directly directly, or via the <i>PnIndex</i> and normals. See Figure 7 for handling of normals.</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the use of <i>IfcTriangulatedFaceSet</i> without annotation. The diagram of the <em>IfcTriangulatedFaceSet</em>  represents the indices and the ordered list into which the indices point. The index starts with 1 (indexed as 1 to N), if the greatest index in <em>CoordIndex</em> in N, then the <em>IfcCartesianPointList</em> shall have N lists of 3:3 coordinates.</p>
