<p>The element type
<em>IfcColumnType</em> defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of columns. The set of shared information may
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common profile definitions</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to define a column specification, or column style
(i.e. the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that column type). Column types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcColumnType</em> within building models
are represented by instances of <em>IfcColumnStandardCase</em> if
the <em>IfcColumnType</em> has a single associated
<em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em>; otherwise they are represented by
instances of <em>IfcColumn</em>. Occurrences of the
<em>IfcColumnType</em> within structural analysis models are
represented by instances of <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em>, or
its applicable subtypes.</p>
