<p><em>IfcRelFillsElement</em> is an objectified relationship between an opening element and an element that fills (or partially fills) the opening element. It is an one-to-one relationship.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict an opening to be filled by one filling element only.

<p>As shown in Figure 2, the insertion of a door into a wall is represented by two separate relationships. First the door opening is created within the wall by <em>IfcWall(StandardCase) &lt;-- IfcRelVoidsElement --&gt; IfcOpeningElement</em>, then the door is inserted within the opening by <em>IfcOpeningElement &lt;-- IfcRelFillsElement --&gt; IfcDoor</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
