<p><em>IfcShapeModel</em> represents
the concept of a particular geometric and/or topological
representation of a product's shape or a product component's shape
within a representation context. This representation context has to
be a geometric representation context (with the exception of
topology representations without associated geometry). The two
subtypes are <em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em> to cover geometric
models that represent a shape, and <em>IfcTopologyRepresentation</em>
to cover the conectivity of a product or product component. The
topology may or may not have geometry associated.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcShapeModel</em> can be a shape representation
(geometric and/or topologogical) of a product (via
<em>IfcProductDefinitionShape</em>), or a shape representation
(geometric and/or topologogical) &nbsp;of a component of a product
shape (via <em>IfcShapeAspect</em>).</p>
