<p>Space heaters utilize a combination of radiation and/or natural convection using a heating source such as electricity, steam or hot water to heat a limited space or area. Examples of space heaters include radiators, convectors, baseboard and finned-tube heaters.</p>
<p><em>IfcUnitaryEquipment</em> should be used for packaged units supporting a combination of heating, cooling, and/or dehumidification; <em>IfcCoil</em> should be used for coil-based floor heating.</p>
