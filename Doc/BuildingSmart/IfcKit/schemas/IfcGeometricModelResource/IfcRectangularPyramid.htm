<p>The <em>IfcRectangularPyramid</em> is a Construction Solid Geometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is a solid with a
rectangular base and a point called apex as the top. The tapers from the base to the top. The axis from the center of
the base to the apex is perpendicular to the base. The inherited <em>Position</em> attribute defines the
<em>IfcAxisPlacement3D</em> and provides the location and orientation of the pyramid:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position</em>: The location and orientation of the axis system for the
primitive.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location</em>: The center of the circular area being the bottom face of the
cone.</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Position[3]:</em> The z-axis of the inherited placement coordinate system
provides the center axis of the <em>IfcRightCircularCone</em>, and the apex is at the <em>Height</em> value applied to
the positive direction of the z-axis. The <em>BottomRadius</em> defines the circular base at the xy-plane of the
placement coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, the pyramid is positioned within its own placement coordinate system. The origin is the
center of the bottom rectangle, that lies in the XY plane. The apex lies on the positive z axis at [0, 0,
<em>Height</em>].</p>

<p class="use-head">Texture use definition</p>
<p>On each triangular side face, textures are aligned facing upright. Textures are stretched or repeated to the extent
of the base of each face according to RepeatS. Textures are stretched or repeated towards the top point according to
Repeat T, where the top point has coordinates of (0.5,1.0) if RepeatT is False.</p>
<p>On the bottom face, textures are aligned facing front-to-back.</p>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates default texture mapping with a clamped texture (RepeatS=False and RepeatT=False). The image
on the left shows the texture where the S axis points to the right and the T axis points up. The image on the right
shows the texture applied to the geometry where the X axis points back to the right, the Y axis points back to the
left, and the Z axis points up.</p>
