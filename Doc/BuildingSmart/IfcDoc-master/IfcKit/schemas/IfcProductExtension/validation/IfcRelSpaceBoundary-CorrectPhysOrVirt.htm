If the space boundary is physical, it shall be provided by an element (i.e. excluding a virtual element). If the space boundary is virtual, it shall either have a virtual element or an opening providing the space boundary. If the space boundary <em>PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary</em> attribute is not defined, no restrictions are imposed.
