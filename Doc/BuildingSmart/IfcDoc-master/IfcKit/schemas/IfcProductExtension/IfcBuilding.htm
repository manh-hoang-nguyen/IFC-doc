<p>A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place. The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).</p>

<blockquote class="extDef">
NOTE&nbsp; Definition from ISO 6707-1:<br>
Construction work that has the provision of shelter for its occupants or contents as one of its main purpose and is normally designed to stand permanently in one place.
</blockquote>

<p>A building is (if specified) associated to a site. A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site. A building can also be decomposed in (vertical) parts, where each part defines a building section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype <em>IfcSpatialStructureElements</em> which is interpreted as follow:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>COMPLEX</b>: building complex</li>
 <li><b>ELEMENT</b>: building</li>
 <li><b>PARTIAL</b>: building section</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>IfcBuilding</em> is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship <em>IfcRelAggregates</em>. Figure 3 shows the <em>IfcBuilding</em> as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

      Figure 4 describes the heights and elevations of the <em>IfcBuilding</em>. It is used to provide the height above
      sea level of the project height datum for this building, that is, the internal height 0.00. The height 0.00 is often used
      as a building internal reference height and equal to the floor finish level of the ground floor.
