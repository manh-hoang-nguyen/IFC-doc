<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>See definitions at <em>IfcStructuralItem</em>.  The local coordinate system is established by the reference surface given by topology representation.</p>

<p><b><u>Topology Use Definitions</u></b>:</p>

<p>Instances of <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</em> shall have a topology representation which consists of one <em>IfcFaceSurface</em>, representing the reference surface of the surface connection.  See definitions at <em>IfcStructuralItem</em> for further specifications.</p>
