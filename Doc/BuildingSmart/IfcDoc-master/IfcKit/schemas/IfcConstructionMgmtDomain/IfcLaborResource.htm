<p>The purpose of an <em>IfcLaborResource</em> is to identify a skillset that may be required or used. The skillset identified may be (for instance) charge-hand, foreman, labourer, plumbers mate etc. and provides a designation of a particular level of skill. It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.</p>

<p>At a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through <em>IfcActor</em>. The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the <em>IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource</em> attribute. The <em>IfcLaborResource</em> provides the <em>IfcRelAssignsToResource</em>.<em>RelatingResource</em> attribute. </p>
