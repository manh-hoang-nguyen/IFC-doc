      EXAMPLE&nbsp; It may be used to describe the
        attachment of one element to another where the attachment
        is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It
        may also be used to describe the mounting of one element
        onto another such as the requirement for the mounting
        major plant items onto builders work bases and/or
        anti-vibration isolators.
