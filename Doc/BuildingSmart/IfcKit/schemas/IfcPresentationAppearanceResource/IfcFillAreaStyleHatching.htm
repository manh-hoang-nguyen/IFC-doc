<p>The <em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em> is used to define simple, vector-based hatching patterns, based on styled straight lines. The curve font, color and
thickness is given by the <em>HatchLineAppearance</em>, the angle by the <em>HatchLineAngle</em> and the distance to the next hatch line by
<em>StartOfNextHatchLine</em>, being either an offset distance or a vector.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:<br> The fill area style hatching defines a styled pattern of curves for hatching an
annotation fill area or a surface.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; If the hatch pattern involves two (potentially crossing) rows of hatch lines, then two instances of
<em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em> should be assigned to the <em>IfcFillAreaStyle</em>. Both share the same (virtual) point of origin of the
hatching that is used by the reference hatch line (or the <em>PointOfReferenceHatchLine</em> if there is an offset).</blockquote>
<p>For better control of the hatching appearance, when using hatch lines with other fonts then continuous, the <em>PatternStart</em> allows to offset the
start of the curve font pattern along the reference hatch line (if not given, the <em>PatternStart</em> is at zero distance from the virtual point of
origin). If the reference hatch line does not go through the origin (of the virtual hatching coordinate system), it can be offset by using the
<em>PatternStart</em> .</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The coordinates of the <em>PatternStart</em> are given relative to the origin of the object coordinate
of <em>IfcAnnotationFillArea</em>, or if present, the <em>FillAreaTarget</em> attribute of <em>IfcAnnotationFillArea</em>. The measure values are given in
global drawing length units, representing a model hatching, and can be translated into drawing units by the <em>TargetScale</em> for a scale depended
<em>IfcGeometricRepresentationSubcontext</em>, if provided.</blockquote>

This example shows simple hatching given by using a curve font "continuous" at <em>HatchLineAppearance</em>.<br>

The distance of hatch lines is given by a positive length measure. The angle (here 45' if measures in degree) is provided by <em>HatchLineAngle</em>.<br>

The point that is mapped to the insertion point of the

Note that the <em>PatternStart</em> now displaces both the reference hatch line from the point of origin and the start of the curve pattern. This can be used
in cases when more than one <em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em> is used in an <em>IfcFillAreaStyle</em> in order to place rows of hatch lines with an offset
from each other.</small></td>
