NOTE&nbsp; Slab foundations, also called slab-on-grade, are not instantiated as <em>IfcFooting</em> but as <em>IfcSlab</em> or as its subtype <em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em>, <em>IfcSlabElementedCase</em> with a predefined type of <em>IfcSlabTypeEnum</em>.BASESLAB. Deep foundations, which transfer the loads to subsurface layers, are represented by <em>IfcPile</em>.
