<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
This function converts a generic list to an array with pre-determined array
bounds. If the array bounds are incompatible with the number of
elements in the original list a null result is returned. This function
is used to construct the array of control points and weights used in
the b-spline entities.</blockquote>
