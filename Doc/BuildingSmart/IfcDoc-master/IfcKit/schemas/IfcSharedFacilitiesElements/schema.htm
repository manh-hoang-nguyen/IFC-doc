<p>The <em>IfcSharedFacilitiesElements</em> schema
defines basic concepts in the facilities management (FM) domain. This
schema, along with <em>IfcProcessExtension</em> and <em>IfcSharedMgmtElements</em>, provide a
set of models that can be used by applications needing to share
information concerning facilities management related issues.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcSharedFacilitiesElements</em> schema
supports ideas including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Furniture. </li>
  <li>Grouping of elements of system furniture into individual
furniture items. </li>
  <li>Asset identification. </li>
  <li>Inventory of objects (including asset, furniture and space
objects within separate inventories).</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>6.4.1.1 Furniture and System Furniture</h3> 
 
<p>In the <em>IfcProductExtension</em> schema, the <em>IfcElement</em> entity is decomposed into a number of subtypes. One of these is the <em>IfcFurnishingElement</em> entity from the <em>IfcFurniture</em> and <em>IfcSystemFurnitureElement</em> entities are derived.</p> 
 
<p>Figure 277 illustrates a furniture object (instance of the <em>IfcFurniture</em> entity, which is considered to be a discrete item of furniture in its own right (for example, a table or chair).</p>

<p>Figure 278 illustrates a system furniture element object (instance of the <em>IfcSystemFurnitureElement</em> entity), which is an identifiable item (such as a modesty panel, side, or desktop) that participates in the assembly of a discrete item of furniture.</p>

</table>
 
<p>Each <em>IfcFurniture</em> object and each <em>IfcSystemFurnitureElement</em>
object is of a particular type. It may be a chair, desk, table etc for
discrete furniture or modesty panel, side panel, desktop etc. for
system furniture. Specification of the type is left to the user of the
application providing the information. For applications however, there
are a number of predefined property sets for types of furniture that
can be assigned to furniture objects. Other property sets may be
defined as necessary.</p> 
 
<h3>6.4.1.2 Asset Identification</h3> 
 
<p>An <em>IfcAsset</em> allows for the grouping of objects to form a unit that has an identifiable financial value and/or upon which specific facilities management operations take place, as shown in Figure 279.</p> 
 
<p>Each asset carries a unique identifier, cost, ownership,location and other information that is required.</p>

</table>
 
<h3>6.4.1.3 Inventory</h3> 
 
<p>An <em>IfcInventory</em> provides a list of objects of a particular
type, the type of objects that are contained being identified by the
<em>IfcInventoryEnum</em>.</p> 
 
<p>Each inventory has one or more responsible persons and an
organizational jurisdiction (which is valuable in facilities management
situations where more than one functional group or organization is
concerned).</p>
