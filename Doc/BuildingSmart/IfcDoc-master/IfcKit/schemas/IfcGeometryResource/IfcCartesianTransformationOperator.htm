<p>An <em>IfcCartesianTransformationOperator</em> defines an abstract supertype of different kinds of geometric
transformations.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A Cartesian transformation operator defines a geometric transformation composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and
uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix T. These vectors are
computed, by the base axis function, from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and, in Cartesian transformation
operator 3d, axis3. If <b>|T|= -1</b>, the transformation includes mirroring. The local origin point <b>A</b>, the
scale value <b><em>S</em></b> and the matrix <b>T</b> together define a transformation.<br>
<br>
The transformation for a point with position vector P is defined by
<blockquote style=" font-size:inherit;">P -&gt; A + <em>S</em>TP</blockquote>
<p style=" font-size:inherit;">The transformation for a direction d is defined by</p>
<blockquote style=" font-size:inherit;">d -&gt; Td</blockquote>
<p style=" font-size:inherit;">The transformation for a vector with orientation d and magnitude k is defined by</p>
<blockquote style=" font-size:inherit;">d -&gt; Td, and<br>
<em>k -&gt; Sk</em></blockquote>
<p style=" font-size:inherit;">For those entities whose attributes include an axis2 placement, the transformation is
applied, after the derivation, to the derived attributes p defining the placement coordinate directions. For a
transformed surface, the direction of the surface normal at any point is obtained by transforming the normal, at the
corresponding point, to the original surface. For geometric entities with attributes (such as the radius of a circle)
which have the dimensionality of length, the values will be multiplied by <em>S</em>.</p>
<p style=" font-size:inherit;">For curves on surface the p curve.reference to curve will be unaffected by any
transformation. The Cartesian transformation operator shall only be applied to geometry defined in a consistent system
of units with the same units on each axis. With all optional attributes omitted, the transformation defaults to the
identity transformation. The Cartesian transformation operator shall only be instantiated as one of its subtypes.</p>
