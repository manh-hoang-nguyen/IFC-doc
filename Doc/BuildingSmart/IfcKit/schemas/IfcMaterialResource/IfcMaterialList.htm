<p><em>IfcMaterialList</em> is a list of the different materials
that are used in an element.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The class <em>IfcMaterialList</em> will normally be used where an element is described at a more abstract
level. For example, for an architectural specification writer, the only information that may be needed about a concrete column
is that it contains concrete, reinforcing steel and mild steel ligatures. It shall not be used for elements consisting of
material layers when the different layers can be defined and the class <em>IfcMaterialLayerSet</em> can be used. Also,
<em>IfcMaterialList</em> shall not be used for elements consisting of a single identifiable material (for example, to represent anisotropic
material).</blockquote>

IFC4 CHANGE  The entity <em>IfcMaterialList</em> is deprecated and shall no longer be used. Use <em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> instead.
