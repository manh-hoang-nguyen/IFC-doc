NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A surface of revolution is the surface obtained by rotating a curve one complete revolution about an axis. The data shall be interpreted as below.<br><br>
	 
The parameterization is as follows where the curve has a parameterization &lambda;(<em>u</em>):

In order to produce a single-valued surface with a complete revolution, the curve shall be such that when expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system (<em>r,&phi; ,z</em>) centred at <b>C</b> with an axis <b>V</b>, no two distinct parametric points on the curve shall have the same values for (<em>r, z</em>). For a surface of revolution the parametric range is 0 &lt; <em>u</em> &lt; 360 degree. The parameterization range for <em>v</em> is defined by referenced curve.</blockquote>
