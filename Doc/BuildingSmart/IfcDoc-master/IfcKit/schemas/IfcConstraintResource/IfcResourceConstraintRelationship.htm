      An <em>IfcResourceConstraintRelationship</em> is a
      relationship entity that enables a constraint to be related
      to one or more resource level objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>IfcResourceConstraintRelationship</em> allows for the
      specification of a constraint to be applied to many entity
      types. An important case is to apply constraints to
      properties. The constraints applied therefore enable a
      property to carry values identifying requirements as well as
      those identifying the fulfilment of those requirements.
