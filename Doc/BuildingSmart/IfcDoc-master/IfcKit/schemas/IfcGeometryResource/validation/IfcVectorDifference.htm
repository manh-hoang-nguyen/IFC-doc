<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
This function returns the difference of the input
arguments as (Arg1 - Arg2). The function returns as a vector the vector
difference of the two input vectors. The input arguments shall both be
of the same dimensionality but may be either directions or vectors. If
both input arguments are vectors they must be expressed in the same
units, if both are directions a unitless result is produced. A zero difference
vector produces a vector of zero magnitude.</blockquote>
