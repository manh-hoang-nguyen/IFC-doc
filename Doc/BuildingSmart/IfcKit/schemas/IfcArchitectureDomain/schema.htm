<p>The <em>IfcArchitectureDomain</em> schema defines basic object concepts used in the architectural domain that have not been generalized and pushed lower in the model (such as shared with other domains or application types).</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Most elements used in the architectural domain are shared with other domians and are consequentially declared in lower level schemas, such as
<em>IfcProductExtension</em>, or <em>IfcSharedBldgElements</em>.</blockquote>

<p>Specific architectural elements that are not already covered by
other schemas are defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>door lining and panel parameters allowing for a limited
parametic description of door shape and operation,</li>
<li>window lining and panel parameters allowing for a limited
parametic description of window shape and operation,</li>
<li>specific permeable covering properties for window and door
openings</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameter definitions are used to enhance the
specification of door and window elements, they are applied to
<em>IfcDoorType</em> and <em>IfcWindowType</em> using the
<em>HasPropertySets</em> relation.</p>
