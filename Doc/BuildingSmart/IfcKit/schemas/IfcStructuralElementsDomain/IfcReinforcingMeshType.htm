<p>The reinforcing element type <b>IfcReinforcingMeshType</b> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of reinforcing meshs. The set of shared information may include: <ul>
<li>common properties with shared property sets</li>
<li>common representations</li>
<li>common materials</li>
<li>common composition of elements</li>
</ul><p>It is used to define a reinforcing mesh type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. 
The <b>IfcReinforcingMeshType</b> may be declared within <em>IfcProject</em> or <em>IfcProjectLibrary</em> using <em>IfcRelDeclares</em> and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of <b>IfcReinforcingMeshType</b> are represented by instances of <em>IfcReinforcingMesh</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcReinforcingMeshType</em> may define the shared geometric representation for many mesh occurrences. The <em>RepresentationMaps</em> attribute refers to a list of <em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations.</p>
