<p>The reinforcing element type <b>IfcTendonType</b> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of tendons. The set of shared information may include: <ul>
<li>common properties with shared property sets</li>
<li>common representations</li>
<li>common materials</li>
<li>common composition of elements</li>
</ul><p>It is used to define a tendon type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. 
The <b>IfcTendonType</b> may be declared within <em>IfcProject</em> or <em>IfcProjectLibrary</em> using <em>IfcRelDeclares</em> and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of <b>IfcTendonType</b> are represented by instances of <em>IfcTendon</em>.</p>

<p class="use-head">Material Use Definition</p>

<p>An associated material denotes the steel grade, preferrably via material classification.  A material constituent set or material profile set may be associated if the cable, bonding mortar or corrosion protection, and tendon sheeth are to be described together by the material association.</p>

<p class="use-head">Geometry Use Definition</p>

<p>The <em>IfcTendonType</em> may define the shared geometric representation for many tendon occurrences. The <em>RepresentationMaps</em> attribute refers to a list of <em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations.</p>
