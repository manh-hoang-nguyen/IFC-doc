<p>
The <em>IfcApprovalResource</em> schema in the resource layer defines basic concepts for approvals to be assigned to any object or object type or property definition in the IFC model derived from <em>IfcRoot</em>. The assignment is done using <em>IfcRelAssociatesApproval</em> in the <em>IfcControlExtension</em> schema. Also, approvals can be assigned to specific resource level objects (documents, properties, persons/organizations or materials), using <em>IfcResourceApprovalRelationship</em>.
