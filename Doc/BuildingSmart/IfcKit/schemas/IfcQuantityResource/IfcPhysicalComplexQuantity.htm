<p>The complex physical quantity, <em>IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity</em>, is an entity that holds a set of single quantity measure value (as defined at the subtypes of <em>IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity</em>), that all apply to a given component or aspect of the element.</p> 

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE: A layered element, like a wall, may have several material layers, each having individual quantities, like footprint area, side area and volume. An instance of <em>IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity</em> would group these individual quantities (given by a subtype of <em>IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity</em>) and name them according to the material layer name by using the <em>Name</em> attribute. The <em>Discrimination</em> attribute would then be 'layer'.
</blockquote>

<p>A section "Quantity Use Definition" at individual entities as subtypes of <em>IfcBuildingElement</em> gives guidance to the usage of the <em>Name</em> and <em>Discrimination</em> attribute to characterize the complex quantities.</p>
