<p>The energy conversion device type <b>IfcCooledBeamType</b> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of cooled beams. The set of shared information may include: <ul>
<li>common properties with shared property sets</li>
<li>common representations</li>
<li>common materials</li>
<li>common composition of elements</li>
<li>common ports</li>
</ul><p>It is used to define a cooled beam type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. 
The <b>IfcCooledBeamType</b> may be declared within <em>IfcProject</em> or <em>IfcProjectLibrary</em> using <em>IfcRelDeclares</em> and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of <b>IfcCooledBeamType</b> are represented by instances of <em>IfcCooledBeam</em>. 
Refer to the documentation at <em>IfcCooledBeam</em> for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.</p>
