<p><em>IfcConnectionVolumeGeometry</em> is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the physical connection (or overlap) of two objects at a volume defined by a solid or closed shell. It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection or interference relationships.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcSolidModel</em> (or the <em>IfcClosedShell</em>) at the <em>VolumeOnRelatingElement</em> attribute defines the volume where the basic geometry items of the interfering elements overlap. The volume geometry and coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the <em>RelatingElement</em>, as specified at the subtypes of the relationship <em>IfcRelConnects</em> that utilizes the <em>IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry</em>. Optionally, the same volume geometry and coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the <em>RelatedElement</em> by using the <em>VolumeOnRelatedElement</em> attribute.</p>
