<p>The element type <em>IfcFlowSegmentType</em> defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow segment and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow segment specification (the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
<p>A flow segment type is used to define the common properties of a flow segment that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow segment is a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit, that typically has only two ports. Flow segment types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcFlowSegmentType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcFlowSegment</em> or its subtypes.</p>
