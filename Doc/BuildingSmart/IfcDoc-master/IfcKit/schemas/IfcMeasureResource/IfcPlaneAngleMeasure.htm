<p>An <em>IfcPlaneAngleMeasure</em> is the value of an angle in a plane.

<p>Usually measured in radian (rad, m/m = 1), but also grads may be used. The grad unit has to be declared as a conversion based unit based on radian unit.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; <em>IfcPlaneAngleMeasure</em> is used where angles need to be described to an accuracy of less than one degree and expressed as decimal parts of an angle. It is widely used for angular measurement except for situations where accuracy needs to be defined using arc measurement; for which purpose the <em>IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure</em> is provided.
