<p>An <em>IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid</em> is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a
<em>Directrix</em>. The swept area is provided by a subtype of <em>IfcProfileDef</em>. The profile is placed
by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees
to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the <em>FixedReference</em> direction. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the <em>FixedReference</em> direction.</p>

<p>The <em>SweptArea</em> is swept along the <em>Directrix</em> in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system 
used to define the <em>SweptArea</em> is on the <em>Directrix</em> and the local X axis is in the direction of the projection of
<em>FixedReference</em> onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that
the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the <em>Directrix</em> at any point is a copy of the
<em>SweptArea</em>. The resulting swept solid is placed by the <em>Position</em> coordinate system.</p>

<p>The <em>Directrix</em> and the <em>ReferenceSurface</em> are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start
of the sweeping operation is at the <em>StartParam</em>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization.
If no <em>StartParam</em> is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is 
at the <em>EndParam</em>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no <em>EndParam</em> is provided 
the end defaults to the end of the directrix.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>StartParam</em> and the <em>EndParam</em> are not normalized by default, they depend
upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the <em>IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment</em> within an 
<em>IfcCompositeCurve</em> as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve.

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object 
coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p-curve at
this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system
lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the <em>FixedReference</em> 
direction. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned.
</blockquote>

<p>The orientation of the <em>SweptArea</em> as it sweeps along the <em>Directrix</em> is precisely defined by a
<em>CartesianTransformationOperator3d</em> with attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LocalOrigin</em> as point (0; 0; 0),</li>
<li><em>Axis1</em> as the <em>FixedReference</em>.</li>
<li><em>Axis3</em> as the direction of the tangent vector <b>t</b> at the point of the <em>Directrix</em> with
parameter <b>u</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix <b>T(u)</b>, which varies
with the <em>Directrix</em> parameter <b>u</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization;
the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the <em>Directrix</em>.</blockquote>
