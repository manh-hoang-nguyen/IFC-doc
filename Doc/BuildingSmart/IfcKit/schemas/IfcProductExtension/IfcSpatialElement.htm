<p>A spatial element is the generalization of all spatial elements that might be used to define a spatial structure or to define spatial zones.</p>
<ul>
 <li>a hierarchical spatial structure element as <em>IfcSpatialStructureElement</em>
  <ul>
   <li>a spatial structure is a hiearchical decomposition of the project. That spatial structure is often used to provide a project structure to organize a building project.</li>
   <li>A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the building project. Elements within the spatial project structure are site, building, storey, and space</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>a spatial zone as <em>IfcSpatialZone</em>
  <ul>
   <li>a spatial zone is a non-hierarchical and potentially overlapping decomposition of the project under some functional consideration.</li>
   <li>a spatial zone might be used to represent a thermal zone, a lighting zone, a usable area zone.</li>
   <li>a spatial zone might be used to represent a horizontal spatial structure as used in civil works.</li>
   <li>a spatial zone might have its independent placement and shape representation.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
