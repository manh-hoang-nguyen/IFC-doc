    <p>
      The <em>IfcRelServicesBuildings</em> is an objectified relationship that defines the relationship between a system
      and the sites, buildings, storeys, spaces, or spatial zones, it serves. Examples of systems are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>building service systems (heating, cooling, waste water system) represented by instances of
      <em>IfcDistributionSystem</em>;
      </li>
      <li>building systems (fenestration, shading) represented by instances of <em>IfcBuildingSystem</em>;
      </li>
      <li>zones as collection of logically grouped spaces represented by instances of <em>IfcZone</em>
      </li>
      <li>idealized structural analysis systems represented by instances of <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
