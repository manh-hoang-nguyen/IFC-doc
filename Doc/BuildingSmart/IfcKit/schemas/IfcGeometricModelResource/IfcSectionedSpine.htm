<p>An <em>IfcSectionedSpine</em> is a representation of the shape of a three dimensional object composed by a number of
planar cross sections, and a spine curve. The shape is defined between the first element of cross sections and the last
element of the cross sections. A sectioned spine may be used to represent a surface or a solid but the interpolation of
the shape between the cross sections is not defined.</p>
<p>All cross sections have to define areas by a closed profile to allow for the representation of a solid. All cross
sections have to define curves by an open or closed profile to allow for the representation of a surface. The cross
sections are defined by subtypes of <em>IfcProfileDef</em>, where the consecutive profiles may be derived by a
transformation of the start profile or the previous consecutive profile.</p>
<p>The spine curve shall be of type <em>IfcCompositeCurve</em>, each of its segments represented by
<em>IfcCompositeCurveSegment</em> shall correspond to the part between exactly two consecutive cross-sections.</p>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates an example of an <em>IfcSectionedSpine</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>SpineCurve</em> is given by an <em>IfcCompositeCurve</em> with two <em>Segments</em>. The
<em>Segments[1]</em> has a <em>ParentCurve</em> of type <em>IfcPolyline</em> and a <em>Transition</em> =
CONTSAMEGRADIENT. The <em>Segments[2]</em> has a <em>ParentCurve</em> of type <em>IfcTrimmedCurve</em> and a
<em>Transition</em> = DISCONTINUOUS.</li>
<li>Each <em>CrossSectionPosition</em> lies at a start or end point of the <em>Segments</em>.</li>
<li>Each <em>CrossSections</em> are inserted by the <em>CrossSectionPositions</em>. The first two cross sections are of
type <em>IfcRectangleProfileDef</em>, the third is of type <em>IfcDerivedProfileDef</em>.</li>
</ul>

A sectioned spine is a representation of the shape of a three dimensional object composed of a spine curve and a number
of planar cross sections. The shape is defined between the first element of cross sections and the last element of this
set.<br>
<br>
NOTE&nbsp; A sectioned spine may be used to represent a surface or a solid but the interpolation of the shape between
the cross-sections is not defined. For the representation of a solid all cross-sections are closed curves.</blockquote>
