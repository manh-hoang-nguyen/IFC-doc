      <em>IfcElementType</em>
      defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions
      of an element and an optional set of product
      representations. It is used to define an element
      specification (i.e. the specific product information, that
      is common to all occurrences of that product type).

      An element type is used to define the common properties of
      a certain type or style of an element that may be applied
      to instances of that element type to assign a specific
      style. Element types (the instantiable subtypes) may be
      exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
