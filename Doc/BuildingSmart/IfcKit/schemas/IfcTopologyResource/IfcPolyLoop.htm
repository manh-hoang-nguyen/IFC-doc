A poly loop is a loop with straight edges bounding a planar region in space. A poly loop is a loop of genus 1 where the loop is represented
by an ordered coplanar collection of points forming the vertices of the loop. The loop is composed of straight line segments joining a point in
the collection to the succeeding point in the collection. The closing segment is from the last to the first point in the collection. 
The direction of the loop is in the direction of the line segments.
<br><br>
A poly loop shall conform to the following topological constraints:
<ul>
  <li class="extDef">the loop has the genus of one.</li>
  <li class="extDef">the following equation shall be satisfied
  <br><img src="../../../figures/ifcpolyloop-math1.gif" height="26" width="138"></li>
</ul>
The <em>IfcPolyLoop</em> is always closed and the last segment is from the last <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em>
in the list of <em>Polygon</em>'s to the first <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em>. Therefore the first point shall not be repeated at the end of the list,
neither by referencing the same instance, nor by using an additional instance of&nbsp;<em>IfcCartesianPoint</em> having the
coordinates as the first point.
