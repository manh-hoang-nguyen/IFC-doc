<p><em>IfcRelVoidsElement</em> is an objectified relationship between a building element and one opening element that creates a void in the element. It is a one-to-one relationship. This relationship implies a Boolean operation of subtraction between the geometric bodies of the element and the opening.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, the insertion of a void into a wall is represented by the relationship <em>IfcRelVoidsElement</em>. The opening is created within the wall by <em>IfcWall(StandardCase) o-- IfcRelVoidsElement --o IfcOpeningElement</em>.</p>
