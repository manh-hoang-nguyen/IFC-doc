<p>The cylindrical surface is a surface unbounded in the direction of <em>z</em>. Bounded cylindrical surfaces are
defined by using a subtype of <em>IfcBoundedSurface</em> with <em>BasisSurface</em> being a cylindrical surface.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE 1&nbsp; A bounded cylindrical surface can be defined by an
<em>IfcRectangularTrimmedSurface</em> with <em>BasisSurface</em> being the cylindrical surface and <em>U1</em> =
0&deg;, <em>U2</em> = 360&deg; and <em>V1</em> = lower bound in <b>z</b>, <em>V2</em> = upper bound in <b>z</b> (if the
plane angle measure is degree). A bounded cylindrical arc surface is provided with |U1 - U2| &lt; 360&deg; (assuming
the Usense and Vsense agree to the sense of the basis surface).</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE 2&nbsp; A non-rectangular bounded cylindrical surface, e.g. the surface of a round wall

a collection of p-curve segments. A p-curve is curve which lies on the basis of a surface and is defined in the
parameter space of that surface.</blockquote>

A cylindrical surface is a surface at a constant distance (the radius) from a straight line. A cylindrical surface is
defined by its radius and its orientation and location. The data is to be interpreted as follows:</p>

C = Position.Location
x = Position.P[1]
y = Position.P[2]
z = Position.P[3]
