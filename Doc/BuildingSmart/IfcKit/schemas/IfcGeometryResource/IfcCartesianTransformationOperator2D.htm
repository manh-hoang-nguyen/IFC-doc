<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A Cartesian transformation operator 2d defines a geometric transformation in two-dimensional space composed of
translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an
orthogonal matrix <b>T</b>. These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1 and axis2 by the base axis
function. If <b>|T|= -1</b>, the transformation includes mirroring.</blockquote>
