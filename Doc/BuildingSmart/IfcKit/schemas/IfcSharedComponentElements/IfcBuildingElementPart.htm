<p><em>IfcBuildingElementPart</em> represents major components as subordinate
parts of a building element. Typical usage examples include precast concrete
sandwich walls, where the layers may have different geometry representations.
In this case the layered material representation does not sufficiently describe
the element. Each layer is represented by an own instance of the
<em>IfcBuildingElementPart</em> with its own geometry description.</p>

<p>The kind of building element part is further specified by a
corresponding instance of <em>IfcBuildingElementPartType</em>,
referred to by <em>IfcRelDefinesByType</em>.</p>
