<p><em>IfcRecurrencePattern</em> defines repetitive time periods on the basis of regular recurrences such as each Monday in a week, or every third Tuesday in a month.  The population of the remaining attributes such as <em>DayComponent</em>, <em>Position</em>, and <em>Interval</em> depend on the specified recurrence type.</p>

<p><em>IfcRecurrencePattern</em> supports various recurrence patterns that are differentiated by a type definition (<em>IfcRecurrencePattern.RecurrenceType</em>), which is required to provide the meaning of the given values. It can be further constrained by applicable times through specified <em>IfcTimePeriod</em> instances, thus enabling time periods such as between 7:00 and 12:00 and between 13:00 and 17:00 for each of the applicable days, weeks or months.</p>
