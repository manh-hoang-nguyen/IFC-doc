<p><em>IfcPositiveInteger</em> is a defined type based on simple data type Integer with the additional restriction to positive integers (excluding zero).</p>

<p>In principle, the domain of <em>IfcInteger</em> is all integer numbers larger than zero. Here the number of bits used for the <em>IfcInteger</em> representation is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.</p>

<p>Type: INTEGER</p>
