NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A pcurve is a curve which lies on the basis of a surface and is defined in the parameter space of that surface. The basis curve is a curve defined in the two-dimensional parametric space of a reference basis surface. Although it is defined by a curve in two dimensional space, the variables involved are <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>, which occur in the parametric representation of the referenced surface, rather than the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, Cartesian coordinates. The basis curve is only defined within the parametric range of the surface.</blockquote>
