      The <em>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</em> is a specialization of a
      faceted B-rep which contains one or more voids in its
      interior. The voids are represented as closed shells which
      are defined so that the shell normal point into the void.

    <ol>
      <li>Each void shell shall be disjoint from the outer shell
      and from every other void shell

      <li>Each void shell shall be enclosed within the outer shell
      but not within any other void shell. In particular the outer
