<p>The element type <em>IfcBeamType</em> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of beams. The set of shared information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common profile definitions</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to define a beam specification, or beam style (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that beam type). Beam types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>
<p>Occurrences of the <em>IfcBeamType</em> within building models are represented by instances of <em>IfcBeamStandardCase</em> if the <em>IfcBeamType</em> has a single associated <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em>; otherwise they are represented by instances of <em>IfcBeam</em>. Occurrences of the <em>IfcBeamType</em> within structural analysis models are represented by instances of <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em>, or its applicable subtypes.</p>
