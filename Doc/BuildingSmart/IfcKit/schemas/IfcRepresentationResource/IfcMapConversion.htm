<p>The map conversion deals with transforming the local engineering coordinate system, often called world coordinate system, into the coordinate reference system of the underlying map.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcMapConversion</em> does not handle the projection of a map from the geodetic coordinate reference system.

<p>The map conversion allows to convert the local origin of the local engineering coordinate system to its place within a map (easting, northing, orthogonal height) and to rotate the x-axis of the local engineering coordinate system within the horizontal (easting/westing) plane of the map.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The z axis of the local engineering coordinate system is always parallel to the z axis of the map coordinate system.

<p>The scale factor can be used when the length unit for the 3 axes of the map coordinate system are not identical with the length unit established for this project (see <em>IfcProject.UnitsInContext</em>), if omitted, the scale factor 1.0 is assumed.</p>
