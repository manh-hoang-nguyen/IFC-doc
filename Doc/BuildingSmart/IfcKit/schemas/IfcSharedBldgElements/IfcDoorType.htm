<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common operation type definitions</li>

</ul>
<p>A door type defines the particular parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through the <em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and the <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> as predefined property sets applicable to doors only.</p>
<p>It is used to define a door specification, or door style (i.e. the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that door type). Door types may be exchanged
without being already assigned to occurrences.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an <em>IfcMappedItem</em>.</blockquote>
