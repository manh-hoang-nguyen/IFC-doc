<p>An <em>IfcCivilElementType</em> is used to define an element specification of an element used within civil engineering works. Civil element types
include for different types of element that may be used to represent information for construction works external to a building. 
<em>IfcCivilElementType</em>'s may include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>linear elements such as sections of a roadway (including carriageway/pavement, verge, median, marker line, kerb etc.);</li>
 <li>elements for connections and junctions including traffic roundabouts, T junctions, 4 way junctions; </li>
 <li>elements for supporting structures such as piers, piles, pylons, and similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specification of the specific types is provided by the inherited attribute <em>IfcElementType.ElementType</em> given as an <em>IfcLabel</em>.
</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; This is due to the range of choices of element type that are available and their expression in different
languages. It is not considered possible to create a reasonably full list of types within an enumeration. It is suggested that selection of
the relevant type be drawn from an available 'feature catalog'.

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcCivilElementType</em> has been intruduced as a stub for future extensions of this specification 
to include an object model for civil engineering works.</blockquote>
