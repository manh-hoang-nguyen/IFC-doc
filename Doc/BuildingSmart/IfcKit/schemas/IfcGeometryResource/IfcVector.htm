<p>An <em>IfcVector</em> is a geometric representation item having both a magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the
vector is solely defined by the <em>Magnitude</em> attribute and the direction is solely defined by the
<em>Orientation</em> attribute.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>DirectionRatios</em> of the <em>Orientation</em> attribute are not used to
define the magnitude.</blockquote>

NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
The vector is defined in terms of the direction and magnitude of the vector. The value of
the magnitude attribute defines the magnitude of the vector. The magnitude of the vector can not be reliable calculated from the components of the orientation attribute. This form of representation was selected to reduce problems with numerical instability. For
example a vector of magnitude 2.0 mm and equally inclined to the coordinate axes could be represented with Orientation
attribute of (1.0,1.0,1.0).</blockquote>
