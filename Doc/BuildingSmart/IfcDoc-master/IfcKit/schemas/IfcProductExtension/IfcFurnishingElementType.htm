<p><em>IfcFurnishingElementType</em> defines a list of commonly shared
property set definitions of an element and an optional set of
product representations. It is used to define an element
specification (the specific product information, that is
common to all occurrences of that product type).</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined
as representation maps (at the level of the supertype
<em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
occurrence instance through the
<em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
<em>IfcMappedItem</em>.

<p>A furnishing element type is used to define the common
properties of a certain type of a furnishing element that may be
applied to many instances of that feature type to assign a
specific style. Furnishing element types (or the instantiable
subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to
occurrences.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcFurnishingElementType</em> are
represented by instances of <em>IfcFurnishingElement</em> (or its
subtypes).</p>
