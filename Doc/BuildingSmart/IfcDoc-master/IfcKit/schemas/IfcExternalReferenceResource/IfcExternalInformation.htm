<p>An <em>IfcExternalInformation</em> is the identification of an information source that is not explicitly represented in the current model or in the project database (as an implementation of the current model). The <em>IfcExternalInformation</em> identifies the external source (classification, document, or library), but not the particular items such as a dictionary entry, a classification notation, or a document reference within the external source</p>

<p>The <em>IfcExternalInformation</em> is an abstract supertype of
all external information entities.</p>
