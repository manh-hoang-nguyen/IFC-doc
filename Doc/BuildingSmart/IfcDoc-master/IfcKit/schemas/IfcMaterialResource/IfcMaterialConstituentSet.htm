<p><em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> is a collection of individual material constituents, each assigning a material to a part of an element. The parts are only identified by a keyword (as opposed to an <em>IfcMaterialLayerSet</em> or <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em> where each part has an individual shape parameter (layer thickness or layer profile).</p>

<blockquote class="example">EXAMPLE The different materials of a window
construction shall be provided for the window lining and the
window glazing. An <em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> is assigned
to the window with two <em>IfcMaterialConstituent</em>'s, one with
the <em>Name</em> = 'Lining', one with the <em>Name</em> =
'Glazing'.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; See the "Material Use Definition" at the individual
element to which an <em>IfcMaterialConstituentSet</em> may apply
for a required or recommended definition of such
keywords.</blockquote>
