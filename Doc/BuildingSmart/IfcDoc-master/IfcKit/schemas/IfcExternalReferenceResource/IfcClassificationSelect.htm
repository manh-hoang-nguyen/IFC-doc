<p>The <em>IfcClassificationSelect</em> enables selection of whether a classification reference is to be referenced from an external source, or whether a classification is referenced as such.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Generally, it is expected that selection will be by <em>IfcClassificationReference</em> to identify an individual classification notation that classifies an element in the building information model. For example an element, such as <em>IfcTank</em>, might be further classified by assigning an <em>IfcClassificationReference</em> with <em>Identification</em> = "L6814" and a <em>ClassificationSource</em> identifying the appropriate version of Uniclass.  <em>IfcClassification</em> should only be selected in
circumstances where there could be a need to indicate the classification system that will be used without associating a notation or reference to an individual object. This may occur for higher level objects such as <em>IfcProject</em>, <em>IfcSystem</em>, or similar. For example an <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em> might be classified to be applicable to a particular version of EuroCode.
