<p>The <em>IfcLibrarySelect</em> enables selection of whether library information is to be contained within an IFC model or is to be referenced from an external source.</p> 

<blockquote class="note">It is expected that selection will be <em>IfcLibraryReference</em> and only rarely <em>IfcLibraryInformation</em>. <em>IfcLibraryInformation</em> should only be selected in circumstances where there could be a need to indicate the libraries that will be used without making individual references. This may occur for higher level objects such as a <em>IfcProject</em> or <em>IfcBuilding</em>.</blockquote>
