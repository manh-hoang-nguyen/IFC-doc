    <p>
      The objectified relationship <em>IfcRelDefinesByTemplate</em>
      defines the relationships between property set template and
      property sets. Common information about property sets, e.g.
      the applicable name, description, contained properties, is
      defined by the property set template and assigned to all
      property sets.

      The <em>IfcRelDefinesByTemplate</em> is a 1-to-N relationship,
      as it allows for the assignment of one property set template
      to a single or to many property sets or quantity sets. Those
      property sets then share the same property set template
      definition.
