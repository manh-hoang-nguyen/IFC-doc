<p>An individual axis, <em>IfcGridAxis</em>, is defined in the context of a design grid.  The axis definition is based on a curve of dimensionality 2. The grid axis is positioned within the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by the <em>IfcGrid</em>.</p>

<p>The standard geometric representation of <em>IfcGridAxis</em> is defined using a 2D curve entity. Grid axes are normally defined by an offset to another axis. The <em>IfcOffsetCurve2D</em> supports this concept. Each grid axis has a sense given by the parameterization of the curve. The attribute <em>SameSense</em> is an indicator of whether or not the sense of the grid axis agrees with, or
opposes, that of the underlying curve.</p>

<p class="small">As shown in Figure 2, the grid axis is defined as a 2D curve within
the xy plane of the position coordinate system. Any curve can be
used to define a grid axis, most common is the use of IfcLine for
linear grids and <em>IfcCircle</em> for radial grids.</p>
<p class="small">Most grids are defined by a pair of axis
lists, each defined by a base grid axis and axes given by an
offset to the base axis. The use of <em>IfcOffsetCurve2D</em> as
underlying AxisCurve supports this concept.</p>
