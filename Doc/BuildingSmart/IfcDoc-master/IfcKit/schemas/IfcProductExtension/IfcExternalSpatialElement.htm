<p>The external spatial element
defines external regions at the building site. Those regions can
be defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>logically - for example, an instance of
<em>IfcExternalSpatialElement</em> could represent the air space
around the building without having an own shape representation,
or</li>
<li>physically - for example, an instance of
<em>IfcExternalSpatialElement</em> could represent the sloping
ground around the building to identify the part of the external
building envelop that is below ground.</li>
</ul>
