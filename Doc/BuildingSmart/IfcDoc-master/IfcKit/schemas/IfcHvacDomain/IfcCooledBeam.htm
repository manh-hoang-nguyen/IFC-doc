<p>A cooled beam (or chilled beam) is a device typically used to cool air by circulating a fluid such as chilled water through exposed finned tubes above a space. Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again.</p>
