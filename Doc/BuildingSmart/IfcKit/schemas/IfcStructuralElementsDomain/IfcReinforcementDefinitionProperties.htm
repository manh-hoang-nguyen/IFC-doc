	 <p> <em>IfcReinforcementDefinitionProperties</em> defines the cross section
		properties of reinforcement included in reinforced concrete building elements.
		The property set definition may be used both in conjunction with insitu and
		precast structures. </p> 

	 <p> This subtype of <em>IfcPropertySetDefinition</em> is used to define the
		reinforcement properties in early design stages, such as in requirement
		definition or scheme design. In later design stages explicit instances of
		subtypes of <em>IfcReinforcingElement</em> are used. The intended usage may be
		indicated using the <em>DefinitionType</em> attribute value as a designator:
		recommended values are 'Reinforcement area requirement' or 'Reinforcement
		configuration requirement'. Other values may be used according to local
		standards. </p> 
	 <p> Only one property set definition of this kind is used for each concrete
		building element in each intended usage indicated by the <em>DefinitionType</em>
		attribute value. This set then defines a list of cross section properties in a
		discrete number of longitudinal sections as instances of
		<em>IfcSectionReinforcementProperties</em> (one for each structural reinforcement
		bar role), which in turn have a section cross section property defined as a
		profile and a number of reinforcement properties, one for each steel grade /
		bar type. </p>
