<p>A window panel is a casement, that is, a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling. The infilling of a window panel is normally glazing. The way of operation is defined in the operation type.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of window panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the window.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcWindowType</em> can define windows consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> has to be included for each window panel. The <em>PanelPosition</em> attribute, in conjunction with the <em>IfcWindowType</em>.OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em>apply. The <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> are included in the list of properties (<em>HasPropertySets</em>) of the
<em>IfcWindowStyle</em>. More information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the <em>IfcWindowType</em> using the <em>IfcPropertySet</em> for dynamic extensions.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> does not hold an own geometric representation. However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the shape of the <em>IfcWindowType</em> (which is inserted by the <em>IfcWindow</em> into the spatial context of the project). The parameters at the <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties</em> define a standard window panel. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the <em>IfcWindow</em>, which inserts the <em>IfcWindowType</em>. It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the window panel within the overall window is determined by the <em>PanelPosition</em> attribute.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, the panel is applied to the position within the lining as defined by the panel position attribute. 
The following parameter apply to that panel: <em>FrameDepth</em>, <em>FrameThickness</em>.</p>
