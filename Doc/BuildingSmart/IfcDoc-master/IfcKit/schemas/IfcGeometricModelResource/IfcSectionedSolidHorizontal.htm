<p>An <i>IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal</i> is a solid model constructed by sweeping potentially varying cross sections along a curve horizontally.</p>

<p>The solid is generated by sweeping the <i>CrossSections</i> between <i>CrossSectionPositions</i> with linear interpolation of profile points, where the profile normal agrees with the tangent of the <i>Directrix</i>, the profile X axis is oriented perpendicularly to the left of the <i>Directrix</i> (same direction as <i>LateralOffset</i> at <i>IfcDistanceExpression</i>) as facing forward along the directrix, and the profile Y axis is oriented upwards according to <i>FixedAxisVertical</i>.</p>

<p>
For sections having cross-section rotated according to a single super-elevation, <i>IfcDerivedProfileDef</i> may be used to indicate such rotation with each <i>ParentProfile</i> referring to the same underlying profile. 
For sections having cross-section transformed according to multiple super-elevations with points varying independently, each profile may be of a different instance but of same type (e.g. <i>IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef</i>), and may optionally have cross section points associated to string lines (“guide curves”) using <i>IfcIndexedPolyCurve</i> with <i>IfcCartesianPointList2DLabelled</i>.</p>


<p>Figure 2 illustrates four girders of a bridge having a constant parameterized profile, two guardrails having a constant arbitrary profile (one of them mirrored), and a bridge deck having a variable arbitrary profile.</p>

<p><u>Informal Propositions:</u></p>
<ol>
<li>No two consecutive sections shall intersect.</li>
<li>If the type of sections is not IfcParameterizedProfileDef (i.e. an arbitrary profile), then the number of points and edges should be the same for two consecutive profiles</li>
<li>If the directrix is not tangent continuous, the resulting solid is created by a miter at half angle between the two segments.</li>
<li>Very sharp edges may result in nearly impossible miter; implementer agreements may define acceptable limits for tangent discontinuity or require the directrix to be tangent continuous.</li>
<li>The directrix shall not intersect</li>
